## Script details

<ScriptDetails />

## Script description

The Kawi script descended from the [Grantha](/scrlang/scripts/gran) script around the 8th century BC and was used across the islands of Borneo, Java, Bali, and Sumatra.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>The script originated in Java, and as a result is also sometimes called Old Javanese.

Kawi was an abugida; consonant characters are read with an inherent vowel. Diacritics are added to the consonant either to suppress the vowel entirely or to change it to a different vowel.

The Kawi alphabet developed around the 16th century AD into the current [Javanese](/scrlang/scripts/java) script. This transition was more stylistic than structural; the visual composition of the script changed but the way it worked stayed the same.

_This script is not currently recognized by the [ISO 15924 standard](http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/), but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes. If you have any information on this script, please add the information to this site. Your contributions can be a great help in refining and expanding the ISO 15924 standard. The [Script Encoding Initiative](http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/sei/) is working to support the inclusion of this script in the standard, and contributions here will support their efforts._
