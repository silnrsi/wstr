Unicode largely treats the Gaelic script as a font variant of the Latin alphabet. However, some letters are encoded separately:

Insular G (U+A77D, U+1D79)
Insular D (U+A779, U+A77A)
Insular F (U+A77B, U+A77C)
Turned insular G (U+A77E, U+A77F)
Insular R (U+A782, U+A783)
Insular S (U+A784, U+A785)
Insular T (U+A786, U+A787)

These were encoded in version 5.1 of the Unicode Standard.
