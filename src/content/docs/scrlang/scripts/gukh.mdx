## Script details

## Script description

Gurung Khema (sometimes called Khe Phri) is one of three scripts used for writing the Eastern and Western Gurung languages spoken in Nepal, Bhutan and India.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>These languages are often known collectively as “Gurung”, although they are not mutually intelligible. Usually, Gurung is written in the [Devanagari](/scrlang/scripts/deva) script; however, in recent times, some Gurung-speaking groups have promoted the use of two other scripts, Gurung Khema and [Khema Tamu Phri](/scrlang/scripts/qa07).

Gurung Khema is an alphasyllabary. It is written with fifty-eight characters: one vowel, twenty-nine consonants, twelve vowel signs, six various signs, and a set of script-specific digits.
