The Kerinci script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+1E740..U+1E76F in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. It is also discussed in [UTN 35: Indonesian and Philippine Scripts and extensions](https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn35/).

Two documents towards inclusion in Unicode have been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee:
- 2011-03-03 Indonesian and Philippine Scripts and extensions not yet encoded or proposed for encoding in Unicode — Christopher Miller ([L2/11-091](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/11-091))
- 2016-04-07 Preliminary proposal to encode the Kerinci script in Unicode — Anshuman Pandey ([L2/16-074](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/16-074))
  - _Recommendations to UTC #148 August 2016 on Script Proposals — Deborah Anderson, Ken Whistler, Rick McGowan, Roozbeh Pournader, Andrew Glass, Laurentiu Iancu, and Lisa Moore ([L2/16-216](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/16-216)) (See section 13 for recommendations)_
