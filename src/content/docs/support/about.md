This site is a collection of articles and information related to supporting writing systems on computers and mobile devices. It is sponsored, developed, and maintained by SIL's _Writing Systems Technology_ team.

The goal is to publish useful information for software developers, font developers, and writing system users. In addition to new content, we plan to consolidate and update relevant information previously published on other SIL websites including [scripts.sil.org][sso], [Font Development Best Practices][fdbp], the [SIL Font Development Guide][silfontdev], and [ScriptSource][scriptsource].

[SIL][sil] is a global, faith-based nonprofit that works with local communities around the world to develop language solutions that expand possibilities for a better life.

SILâ€™s [_Writing Systems Technology_][wstech] team provides technical support for all aspects of writing system use. We want all living languages to have adequate computer support for the way they are written down using scripts and alphabets. Adequate support includes software for keyboarding and data entry, text encoding, linguistic analysis, rendering, and publishing. We focus on developing and supporting foundational technologies that enable language communities and the broad computing and publishing industry to use writing systems, including [fonts][sil-fonts] and [keyboards][keyman]. We also advocate on behalf of language communities to increase computer support for their writing systems.
