The Naxi Geba script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+1AD00..U+1AFFF in the {link:http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/ Roadmap to the SMP} for the Unicode Standard. There seems to be disagreement on whether Naxi Dongba and Nakhi Geba should be considered the same script (see also the {link:https://scriptsource.org/entry/lb7t8h9k6v Unicode Status (Naxi Dongba)} entry).
