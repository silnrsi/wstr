## Script details

## Script description

The Satavahana dynasty was a royal Indian dynasty whose empire covered much of India from 230 BC possibly up until 220 AD.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>Satavahana rulers encouraged the use of the Prakrit language, although Sanskrit and Telegu were also used. They wrote in a Brahmic script about which little is known. The script appears to be closely related to [Brahmi](/scrlang/scripts/brah) and there are conflicting reports as to whether they are simply variations of the same script.
