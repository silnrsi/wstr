<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>The Elymaic script was descended from [Aramaic](/scrlang/scripts/armi), and was either the parent or a sibling script for [Mandaic](/scrlang/scripts/Mand). It is poorly attested on coins and rock inscriptions from the second and third centuries.
