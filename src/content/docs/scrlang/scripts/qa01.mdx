## Script description

Fula Dita, also called Fula A or Fula 1, was created by Oumar Dembele and used between 1958 and 1966.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>It is an alphabet written with thirty-one consonant letters and eight vowels. Fula Dita is one of two African scripts created for the Fula languages spoken in Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gambia, Chad, Sierra Leone, Benin, Guinea-Bissau, Sudan, Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Liberia, and Gabon. The second of these scripts is [Fula Ba](/scrlang/scripts/qa02). The Fula languages are more commonly written with the [Latin](/scrlang/scripts/latn) or [Arabic](/scrlang/scripts/arab) scripts (Ajami style) than with either of the two Fula alphabets. Of the two, Fula Dita was used more widely than Fula Ba.
