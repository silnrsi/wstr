## Inline USV example #1

Instead of writing "U+0634 ش ARABIC LETTER SHEEN" (and trying to figure out how to type the correct character and find the exact Unicode character name), you can just write `<Character usv="0634"/>` to produce carefully-styled text with USV, character and Unicode character name: <Character usv="0634"/>

You can also specify a character by typing it literally `<Character char="á"/>` to produce: <Character char="á"/>


## Inline USV example #2

### From the glossary, using inline HTML:
```html
Transformation of data to a normal form. For historical reasons,
the Unicode Standard allows some characters to have more than one
encoded representation. For example, _á_ may be represented as a single codepoint,
<span class='USV'>U+00E1</span>&nbsp;<span class='UnicodeCharName'>
LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE</span>, or two codepoints, <span class='USV'>
U+0061</span>&nbsp;<span class='UnicodeCharName'>LATIN SMALL LETTER A</span>
and <span class='USV'>U+0301</span>&nbsp;<span class='UnicodeCharName'>COMBINING 
ACUTE ACCENT</span>. A normalization scheme is used to standardize the codepoints
so that every character is always represented by the same sequence of codepoints.
Normalization is described in the Unicode Standard Section 5.7, Normalization.
```

For example, á may be represented as a single codepoint, U+00E1 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE, or two codepoints, U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A and U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT.

Normalization is described in the Unicode Standard Section 5.7, Normalization.


### Using the `Character` component:
```html

standard allows some characters to have more than one encoded representation. 
For example, á may be represented as a single codepoint, <Character char="á"/>, 
or two codepoints, <Character char="a"/> and <Character usv="0301"/>.

## CharacterTable example

```html
<CharacterTable startUsv="063D" endUsv="063F" caption="Farsi Yeh forms"/>
```

Consider these Farsi Yeh forms:

<CharacterTable startUsv="063D" endUsv="063F" caption="Farsi Yeh forms"/>


## ScriptInfo example

```html
<ScriptInfo scriptCode="Beng" />
```

<ScriptInfo scriptCode="Beng" />


## ScriptTable example

Show scripts that are do reordering:
```html
<ScriptTable filter="script_reordering=yes" />
```

<ScriptTable filter="script_reordering=yes" />


## DataTable example

The following table displays data from the `characters` table, showing USV and character name. The results are filtered to include only records where the `character_category` is `Lm` and Unicode version is 3.0, and are sorted by `usv` in ascending order.

```html
<DataTable 
  table   = "characters" 
  fields  = "character_usv=USV, character_name=Character Name" 
  filter  = "character_category = 'Lm' AND character_unicodeVersion = '3.0'" 
  order   = "character_usv ASC" 
  caption = "List of Modifier Letters (Lm) added in Unicode 3.0"
/>
```

<DataTable 
  table   = "characters" 
  fields  = "character_usv=USV, character_name=Character Name" 
  filter  = "character_category = 'Lm' AND character_unicodeVersion = '3.0'" 
  order   = "character_usv ASC" 
  caption = "List of Modifier Letters (Lm) added in Unicode 3.0"
/>
