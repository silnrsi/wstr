## Script details

<ScriptDetails />

## Script description

The Old Italic scripts are a group of alphabets descended from Greek which were used for writing a number of languages spoken in what is now Italy.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>The exact relationship of the Old Italic scripts to one another is uncertain. The most notable among them are Etruscan, Oscan, Faliscan, (ancient) Latin, Umbrian and Messapic. Scripts including the ancient Raetic, Venetic, Lepontic and Gallic scripts were previously termed the Alpine (or North Italic) scripts; these are now considered to belong to the Old Italic scripts.

The Runic and modern Latin scripts were based on the Old Italic alphabets.
