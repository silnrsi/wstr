There are three ways to contact the team that maintains this site:

**If you have a comment, correction, suggestion, or request related to the site content** the best way to contact us is to [create a new issue in the Github repository][gh-issues] for this site.

**If you have a general question about writing systems computing, need technical help, or would prefer an alternative to Github**, contact us through the [SIL Language Software Community Writing Systems forum][community-forum].

**If neither of those methods work for you, or you would prefer a private way to contact us**, you can use the [contact form on the SIL Language Technology site][sil-wstech-contact], although this may slow down the conversation as we determine how to best redirect your message to an appropriate person.

Please understand that we have very limited staff and may not be able to answer all enquiries.
