The Pyu script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+117B0..U+117FF in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard.

## Proposals and documents

A number of proposals for its inclusion have been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and WG2:
- 1992-10-30 Pyu / Tircul — Rick McGowan ([Unicode Technical Report #3 R2](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr3-2/))
- 2010-08-05 Preliminary Code Chart and Names List for the Pyu Script — Anshuman Pandey ([WG2 N3874](https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n3874.pdf), [L2/10-295](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/10-295))
