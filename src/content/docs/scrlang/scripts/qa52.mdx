<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>It is not known whether this script is still in use; some scholars claim it is extinct whilst others claim it is still used in rural areas. The present official script for writing Zhuang is [Latin](/scrlang/scripts/latn).

The Zhuang Square  script is made up of a combination of Chinese characters, Chinese-like characters, and symbols borrowed from other scripts such as the [Latin](/scrlang/scripts/latn) alphabet and (possibly) [Myanmar](/scrlang/scripts/mymr). There is only one dictionary published in Zhuang Square script; this lists 10,000 characters.
