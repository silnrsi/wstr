The Unicode Standard considers Fraktur type to be a font variant of the Latin script, so it is not encoded separately. There are a number of additional ligatures needed for processing Fraktur text; these are not proposed for encoding in Unicode. Rather, smart-font technologies such as OpenType, AAT or Graphite are used by font designers to enable these ligatures to be printed.
