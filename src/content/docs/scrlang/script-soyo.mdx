## Script features

<ScriptInfo />
## Script description

The Soyombo script was developed by the Mongolian monk and scholar Bogdo Zanabazar in 1686 to write Mongolian.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>According to legend, Zanabazar based the script on letter-like signs he saw in the sky one night. Other theories suggest that the shapes of the letters may have been based on the [Ranjana](/scrlang/script-qabb) script of Nepal.

The Mongolian language had been written for centuries before the creation of  Soyombo, using the [Mongolian script](/scrlang/script-Mong), but Zanabazar was the first to write it horizontally.

Soyombo can also be used to write Tibetan and Sanskrit.
