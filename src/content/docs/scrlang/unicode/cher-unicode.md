The Cherokee syllabary was first encoded in The Unicode Standard version 3.0. In Unicode 8.0 casing was added to the script. The script is now encoded in the following blocks:

table:
Blocks|Character Range|Added in Unicode Version|Unicode Chart|

Cherokee Supplement|AB70..ABBF|8.0|{link:http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UAB70.pdf UAB70}|
