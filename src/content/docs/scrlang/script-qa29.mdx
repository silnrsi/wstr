## Script description

The Byblos script is thought to have been used for writing a Semitic language between the 24th and the 15th centuries BC.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...'</summary>It is known from ten inscriptions discovered in the city of Byblos, in present-day Lebanon. As yet, the script is undeciphered, but is thought to have been a syllabary written from right to left using approximately one hundred distinct signs. Some signs appear to resemble [Egyptian hieroglyphs](/scrlang/script-egyp); others resemble [Phoenician](/scrlang/script-Phnx) characters. It is thought that the Byblos inscriptions may represent an important link between the Egyptian hieroglyphic script and the later Semitic abjads.
