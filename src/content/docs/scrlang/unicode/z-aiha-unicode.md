The Aiha script is not yet in Unicode. The script is in: [Not The Roadmap](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/not-the-roadmap/) because it has been considered unsuitable for encoding.

However, a number of documents, including a recent one, towards its inclusion have been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and WG2:

- 1997-1-21 Aiha chart - Michael Everson ([aiha.html](http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/aiha.html))

- 2023-06-16 Preliminary proposal for encoding the Aiha script in the SMP of the UCS (WG2 N5226) â€” Michael Everson ([L2/23-136](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/23-136))

  - _Recommendations to UTC #176 July 2023 on Script Proposals ([L2/23-164](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/23-164)) (See point B.15.)_

  - _UTC #176 Minutes ([L2/23-157](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2023/23157.htm)) (See D.1 Section 15 for decision and action items)_
