## Script details

## Script description

Kaida was primarily used for record-keeping and the characters comprise of a combination of pictographs, _kanji_-like characters, markings and numerals, and symbols used to indicate families.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>Kaida has been found on boards, paper, wooden sticks and knotted strings of rope. It was used in the Yaeyama islands and the island of Yonaguni, both of which are today part of Japan. The script dates to at least the late 19th century. Today it is found in folk art, and items such as tee-shirts.  

There are different types of characters in Kaida writing. The pictographic glyphs themselves are referred to as _kaida-di_. Not all of these glyphs are arbitrary, as some were designed to look like their referent, while others were not. Characters for numbers and indicators of the month and day bear a strong resemblance to the _kanji_ characters of China and Japan. In addition, there are six characters, called _sūchūma_, used to represent different volume measurements. These characters not only represent volume, but can also be used to express numerical values. Kaida also makes use of several dots, although their significance is still yet to be determined. Lastly, there are symbols, called _dahan_, which indicate individual families.
