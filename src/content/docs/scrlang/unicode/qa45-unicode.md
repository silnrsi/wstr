The Numidian script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+10960..U+1097F in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. 

An early proposal towards encoding the script is the only document currently available:
- 1992-10-23 Tifinagh, Numidian â€” Rick McGowan ([Unicode Technical Report #3 R2](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr3-2/))

## Blocks
