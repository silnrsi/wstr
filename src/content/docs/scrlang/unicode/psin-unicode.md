Proto-Sinaitic was originally investigated and rejected as unsuitable for encoding. That status has now changed. 

The Proto-Sinaitic script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+108B0..U+108DF in the {link:http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/ Roadmap to the SMP} for the Unicode Standard.
