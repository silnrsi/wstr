## Script description

Khema Tamu Phri is one of three scripts used for writing the Eastern and Western Gurung languages spoken in Nepal, Bhutan and India.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>These languages are often known collectively as “Gurung”, although they are not mutually intelligible. Usually, Gurung is written in the [Devanagari](/scrlang/scripts/deva) script; however, in recent times, some Gurung-speaking groups have promoted the use of two other scripts, Khema Tamu Phri and [Gurung Khe Phri](/scrlang/scripts/Qa04).

Khema Tamu Phri is an abugida. There are twenty-nine consonant letters, each representing a syllable containing a consonant and the vowel /a/. This vowel can be changed by adding one of seven vowel signs to the consonant letter, or silenced by adding a _virama_ character. Vowels which do not follow a consonant, for example those at the start of a word, are written with one of eight independent vowel letters.

Some of the letter shapes are closely modeled on their Devanagari or Tibetan equivalents.

It is not known how widely this script is used, and it seems to be a topic of controversy with supporters and opponents among Gurung speakers.
