What is a language tag? See docs in languages repo

SILâ€™s `langtags.json` file resides in the a langtags repo. Information on making a maximal and minimal language tag is derived from various sources.

- `langtags.csv` is manually maintained. We have close cooperation with the Ethnologue script editor. Any new information on writing systems for a particular language in the Ethnologue is passed on to be included in the `langtags.csv` file and vice-versa.
- [IANA Language Subtag Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) - this file is placed in [sldrtool repo](https://github.com/silnrsi/sldrtools) and is available [here](https://github.com/silnrsi/sldrtools/blob/master/lib/sldr/language-subtag-registry.txt). (LE:This makes no sense to me why it would not be in the langtags repo.)
   - ISO 639-1
   - [ISO 639-3](https://iso639-3.sil.org/) (no files are directly used, IANA incorporates the changes)
- [Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/codes/) (`LanguageIndex.tab` is renamed `langindex.tab` and placed in `langtags/source`
   - `autonyms.csv` is from the Ethnologue, but it is not publicly available for download from the Ethnologue.
- [ISO 15924](https://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html) script codes are used. However, no downloaded files are used, the information is manually added to `langtags.csv`.
   - A few of the script codes may need to be described.
     - Zyyy is used for when the script is unknown
     - Zxxx is used for Sign languages
     - Zzzz is used for unencoded scripts. In those cases a subtag indicates the script name
- ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes are used. However, these are derived from the Ethnologue `LanguageIndex.tab` file which includes all the regions.
- We are in the process of incorporating [ROLV (Registry of Language Varieties) codes](https://hisregistries.org/rolv/). At this point these would be processed as private subtags.
- During the build process of `langtags.json`, the sldr files are also used for testing purposes. Any language tags that are used in the sldr files should be added to `langtags.csv`. If the sldr file is incorrect, it should be corrected.
