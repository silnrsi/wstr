    The Arabic script in Africa contains sixteen papers on the past and present use of Arabic
    script to write African languages. These writing traditions, which are sometimes collectively
    referred to as Ajami, are discussed for single or multiple languages, with examples from all
    major linguistic phyla of Africa but one (Khoisan), and from all geographic areas of Africa
    (North, West, Central, East, and South Africa), as well as a paper on the Ajami heritage in the
    Americas. The papers analyze (ethno-) historical, literary, (socio-) linguistic, and in
    particular grammatological aspects of these previously understudied writing traditions and
    exemplify their range and scope, providing new data for the comparative study of writing
    systems, literacy in Africa, and the history of (Islam in) Africa.
  annotation: >-
    This book is relevant for the history of knowledge and literacy in (Islamic) Africa, the
    linguistic study of writing systems (Grammatology), the socio-linguistics of writing, and
    orthography development and standardization.[CR][CR]A comprehensive review of this book is
    also available.

    With the advent of multi-lingual concept in computer systems, different solution has been
    proposed and implemented. But most of these are not matured enough or has platform barriers.
    The most promising solutions are OpenType® by Microsoft and Adobe, and Apple Advanced
    Typography by Apple Inc. The OpenType® specifications are open source, in spite of that the
    support of OpenType® on different platforms is not mature and even not consistent among
    Microsoft and Adobe applications.(CR)(CR)Two different techniques have been adapted to digitize
    the Nastaleeq script. One is Ligature based approach and other is character based. Both
    approaches have their own limitations. The most dominating solution is ligature based Nori
    Nastaleeq font. But this font can only be run in proprietary software InPage®. And this
    software can only be run in a MS Windows environment. The other promising solution is character
    based Nafees Nastaleeq font. This font uses OpenType® technology to generate ligatures.
    OpenType® solution is very slow for Nastaleeq script and has limitations for proportional
    spacing and justification.(CR)(CR)TeX is a revolutionary typesetting system developed by
    Donald Knuth in 1980s. It is a defecto standard for many scientific and mathematic
    publications. TeX was mainly aimed at typesetting mathematics and English text. Omega is an
    extension of TeX developed by John Plaice and Yannis Haralambous. Its first release, aims
    primarily at improving TeX's multilingual abilities. Omega allows multiple inputs and output
    character sets, and uses programmable filters to translate from one encoding to another, to
    perform contextual analysis. The pixel level control of TeX over glyphs and filtering approach
    of Omega suits them best for complex scripts like Nastaleeq.

    This thesis goes into great detail about how the Nastaleeq style of Arabic script works. It is a
    useful read for anyone interested in implementing support for Nastaleeq.
