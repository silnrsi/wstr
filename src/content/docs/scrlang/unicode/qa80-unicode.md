The Kaida script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+1A780..U+1A7FF in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. It may not be considered a script but could end up being a collection of symbols.

A detailed proposal is not yet available. However, there was a discussion on the script on the [Unicode mailing list](http://unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2011-m02/0060.html).
