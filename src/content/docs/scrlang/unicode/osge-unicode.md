In The Unicode Standard, Osage script implementation is discussed in [Chapter 20 Americas](http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/ch20.pdf).

The Osage script was encoded in The Unicode Standard version 9.0. The script is now encoded in the following block: 

| Blocks | Character Range | Added in Unicode Version | Unicode chart |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Osage  | 104B0..104FF | 9.0 | [U104B0.pdf](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U104B0.pdf) |

At one point there was an intention for the script to be unified with Latin. However, at UTC #140 the decision was made to encode it as a separate script ([L2/14-177](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2014/14177.htm)).

A number of proposals for its inclusion have been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and WG2:

- 2014-02-20 Preliminary proposal to encode the Osage script in the UCS — Michael Everson ([WG2 N4548](https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n4548.pdf), [L2/14-068](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/14-068))

- 2014-07-30 Proposal to encode Latin characters for Osage — Michael Everson, Herman Mongrain Lookout, Cameron Pratt        ([WG2 N4587](https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n4587.pdf), [L2/14-175](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/14-175))

- 2014-09-21 Final proposal to encode the Osage script in the UCS — Michael Everson, Herman Mongrain Lookout, Cameron Pratt ([WG2 N4619](https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n4619.pdf), [L2/14-214)](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/14-214)
