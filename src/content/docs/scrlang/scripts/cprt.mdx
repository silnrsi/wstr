## Script description

The Cypriot script was used from approximately the 11th to the 4th centuries BC, for writing the Greek language in Cyprus.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>It descended from the Linear A script, and is closely related to the Linear B script, but has no visual or structural relationship to the Greek alphabet. The script was used primarily for record keeping, not for literary purposes.

The Cypriot script was a syllabary, with each of fifty-six letters representing an open (CV) syllable. It was written from right to left without interword spacing. Voiced sounds were under-represented in the script, despite being distinctive in speech. For example, the _p_ series of letters (pa, pe, pi, po, pu) represented syllables beginning with both [p] and [b].

In order to represent syllables with a structure other than CV, for example, CCV, CVC or CVV (diphthongs), certain spelling conventions were implemented. Consonant clusters were written using CV signs whose vowels agreed with the vowel of the whole syllable. So _bre_ was written using the signs be+re. In consonant clusters in which a nasal preceded another consonant, the nasal was not written. Closed CVC syllables were written using the _e_ series of sounds. In spoken Greek, only the consonants [n], [r], and [s] were used at the end of a word, so only the signs representing _ne_, _re_ and _se_ were written to close a syllable. Diphthongs were always written out, with the independent vowel signs representing the second part of the diphthong.

Word breaks were not indicated by spaces or any other means.
