## Script description

The Old Uighur language is an extinct variety of Old Turkic spoken in the Tarim basin.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...'</summary>It is an ancestor of the modern Uyghur language. The language was written using what has been described as an “alphabetized abjad”, with <a href='/reference/glossary#matlec'>matres lectionis</a> used for indicating both long and short vowels. The Old Uighur script was the prototype for the Mongolian and Manchu scripts.
