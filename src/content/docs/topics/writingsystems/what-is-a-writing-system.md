Language is primarily a spoken means of communication. _Writing systems_ (also called _orthographies_) are ways of communicating on printed or visual media, and are usually, but not always, based on spoken languages. A _script_, sometimes referred to using terms such as _alphabet_ and _syllabary_, is a collection of symbols (typically with accompanying rules of behavior) that forms the basis for writing many languages.

This leads to a basic definition of a _writing system_: **the use of one or more scripts to form a complete system for writing a particular language**. Note that a writing system is unique to a specific language, or language family. Although Russian and Ukranian share the same Cyrillic script, they represent two distinct writing systems.
