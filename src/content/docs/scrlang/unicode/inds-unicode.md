The Indus script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+12E00..U+12F8F in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. 

One proposal for its inclusion has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and WG2:

- 1999-01-29 Proposal for encoding the Indus script in Plane 1 of the UCS â€” Michael Everson ([WG2 N1959](https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n1959.pdf), [L2/99-057](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L1999/n1959.pdf))
