The Lisu Monosyllabic script is not yet in Unicode. The script is not yet in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard.

## Proposals and documents

One proposal for its inclusion has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee:
- 2019-04-16 Proposal to Encode the Lisu Monosyllabic Scripts â€” China NB (WG2 N5047, [L2/19-208](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/19-208))
  - _Recommendations to UTC #160 July 2019 on Script Proposals ([L2/19-286](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19286-script-recs.pdf)) (See point 15.)_
