[Hyphenation][hyphenation] is the process of using a hyphen or another punctuation mark to connect two or more words together to form a compound word, or to split a word across lines of text. Hyphenation can improve improve readability by either joining syllables or words, or breaking them apart at appropriate points. Hyphenation is often required when text is [justified][justification]. These two concepts are closely tied together.

Interesting hyphenation behaviors occur in some Latin script use, as in the German word “backen” which becomes “bak-ken” when hyphenated (although there are moves for this to be abandoned). Hyphenation rules in the publishing application need to be fully customizable for these types of behaviors.

Hyphenation is generally a tool used in Latin typesetting, but it is not always allowed in other writing systems. 

One interesting case of different hyphenation methods is Ethiopic. Because Ethiopic was traditionally written using the *Hulet Neteb* there was no need for a hyphenation character. If a line broke at the end of a word the *Hulet Neteb* or other punctuation would be used. However, if a line broke in the middle of the word, the reader just saw the word break with no hyphen. In Figure 1, line two is “hyphenated,” line one is not.

![“Hyphenation” in line two with use of white space (Ethiopic)](images/6230-2-Ethi.png "Figure 2. Line-breaking in line two with use of white space (Ethiopic)")

The difficulty now arises that although word breaking still sometimes occurs this way but, with software limitations encouraging the use of white space between words (rather than the *Hulet Neteb*), it is difficult to know if there is a complete word at the end of a line or if it is a “broken” word (compare Figure 2 with Figure 1).
