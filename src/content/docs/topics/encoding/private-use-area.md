The Private Use Area (PUA) is a range of codepoints that are reserved in Unicode for private-use by software developers and end users who need a special set of characters for their own purposes.

The SIL PUA registry can be accessed [here](https://github.com/silnrsi/unicode-resources/tree/main/sil-pua).
