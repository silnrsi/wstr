The Marchung script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+1E560..U+1E59F in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. 

The [Script Encoding Initiative](https://sei.berkeley.edu/) includes this script in their list of “Scripts Not Yet Encoded”. Contributions here may support their efforts.
