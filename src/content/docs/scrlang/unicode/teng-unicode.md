The Tengwar script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+16080..U+160FF in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard.

## Proposals and documents

One proposal for its inclusion has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and WG2:
- 1997-09-18 Proposal to encode Tengwar in Plane 1 of ISO/IEC 10646-2 00 Michael Everson ([WG2 N1641.htm](https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n1641/n1641.htm), L2/97-271 (not online))
