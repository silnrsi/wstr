Visible Speech is not part of the Unicode Standard. However the {link:http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/ ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR)} has defined a range of the Unicode Private Use Area for Visible Speech. CSUR unoficially coordinates artificial/constructed scripts, which facilitates font development and interoperability.
