## Terms of Service

This website is a service operated by SIL Global (SIL) to serve language communities worldwide. Our postal contact address is SIL Writing Systems Technology, Dept: Key 100, 7500 West Camp Wisdom Road, Dallas, TX 75236, USA. These Terms of Service apply only to what is provided through this website, and not to other services of SIL Global.

This website contains technical guidance and information on scripts, characters, languages, and writing systems for use in linguistic research and software development. All content will be presented with clearly identified authorship, copyright, and licensing.

This information is provided as a "best effort" service. We will make a reasonable effort to provide an high level of service, and make the site available at all times except for necessary downtime for maintenance, but cannot guarantee site availability in the short- or long-term. Although we intend for this to be a long-lasting resource, there is no guarantee that the information will always remain accessible. We also reserve the right to limit uses of bandwidth or storage that adversely impact other users.

The authors and editors of this site take great care in researching, refining, validating, and organising the content. However, SIL makes no express or implied warranty of any kind to ensure the validity, quality, and accuracy of any content and assumes no responsibility for possible errors or omissions. No liability is assumed for incidental or consequential damages in connection with or arising out of the use of the information or resources provided.

All trademarks and commercial designations belong to their respective owners.

Fair use, fair dealing, and other limitations and exceptions to copyright differ between countries and legal systems. This website does not define these uses for content on this web site. You are responsible for knowing the rules and limitations of these within your legal jurisdictions. Generally it is far better to operate within the terms of the individual content licenses than to make any assumptions regarding fair use or fair dealing.
