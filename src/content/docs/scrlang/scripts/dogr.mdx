## Script details

<ScriptDetails />

## Script description

The Dogra or Dogri script is a Brahmi-based alphasyllabary that is written from left to right.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>Independent and initial vowels are written using letters, while dependent vowels are expressed using combining signs. Consonant letters possess the inherent vowel _a_, which is changed by the attachment of a vowel sign. Consonant clusters are written in various ways, such as with visible _halanta_, as an atomic ligature, and with half-forms; _repha_ is attested, but rarely used. There are no formal conventions regarding representation of conjuncts.
