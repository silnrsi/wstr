## Script details

## Script description

The Zou script is used by speakers of the Zomi language (also called Zo or Zou) in the adjoining regions of Chin State, Myanmar and Manipur, India.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>Zomi is a Tibeto-Burman language with about 50,000 speakers. The script was developed by M. Siahzathang, a Manipuri, in 1952. The official script for the Zomi language is [Latin](/scrlang/scripts/latn).

The Zou script is written from left to right. It is unusual amongst South- and East Asian scripts in that it possesses upper and lower case. The script combines features of an alphabet and features of an abugida.

The Zou script has been in decline since the mid-1970s but the Zou Literature Society has been trying to revive it since the 1990s.
