Tibetan does not have visible word breaks and so the only variable white space is after the _shad_ (&#x0F0D;). In Figure 1 one can see that lines four, five and six are “completed” (or justified) with a series of syllable markers (&#x0F0B;) while the other lines are justified via the variable space after each _shad_.
