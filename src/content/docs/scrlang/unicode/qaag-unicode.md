Ersu Hieroglyphs (or Ersu Shaba Picture Writing) is not yet in Unicode. It is also not yet in the Roadmap to the UCS.

Two documents toward encoding the script have been submitted to the UTC:

- 2016-09-22 Preliminary Proposal for encoding Primitive Scripts in Southwest China in the SMP of the UCS — Liming Zhao ([L2/16-262](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/16-262))

- 2017-09-24 Preliminary Proposal on Encoding Ersu Hieroglyphs — Zhao Liming, Wang Yihua ([L2/17-341](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/17-341))
