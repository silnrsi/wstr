The Lisu Syllabic script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+1B600..U+1B9FF in the {link:http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/ Roadmap to the SMP} for the Unicode Standard. 

One proposal for its inclusion has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and WG2:

2019-04-16 Proposal to Encode the Lisu Monosyllabic Scripts â€” China NB (WG2 N5047, {link:http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/19-208 L2/19-208})
