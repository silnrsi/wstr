Visible Speech is not part of the Unicode Standard. However the [ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR)](http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/) has defined a range of the Unicode Private Use Area for Visible Speech. CSUR unoficially coordinates artificial/constructed scripts, which facilitates font development and interoperability.
