Runic script was encoded in The Unicode Standard version 3.0. The script is encoded in the following block:

table:
Blocks | Character Range | Added in Unicode Version | Unicode Chart |
Runic| 16A0..16FF | 3.0 | {link:http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U16A0.pdf U16A0.pdf} |

Runic should not be confused with Hungarian Runic which is being discussed for encoding in The Unicode Standard.
