## Markdown extensions

The following extensions to markdown support may be useful. They require using the `.mdx` file format rather than `.md`.

### Badges

See [Starlight docs - Badges][starlight-badges].

<Badge text="Note" variant="note" />
<Badge text="Success" variant="success" />
<Badge text="Tip" variant="tip" />
<Badge text="Caution" variant="caution" />
<Badge text="Danger" variant="danger" />

<Badge text="New" size="small" />
<Badge text="New and improved" size="medium" />
<Badge text="New, improved, and bigger" size="large" />

<Badge text="Custom" variant="success" style={{ fontStyle: 'italic' }} />

### Steps

See [Starlight docs - Steps][starlight-steps].

<Steps>

1. Import the component into your MDX file:

   ```js
   import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
   ```

2. Wrap `<Steps>` around your ordered list items.

</Steps>

### Caption styling

(to be added)

## Test of markdown in an MDX files

### Text formatting

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~, or `inline code`. Note that for clarity please use double asterisks for bold and single underscores for italic.

### Headings

Heading 1 is only used by the page title. Anchors are automatically generated for all level 2 `<h2>` and level 3 `<h3>` headings. The heading title can be added to the page URL with a hash, replacing spaces with hyphens, and making it all lowercase. A heading of 'AI use' would become `#ai-use`.

## Heading 2 - main headings on a page

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

```

### Lists

- First item
- Second item
    - Sub item
    - Another
- Third item

```

```

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

```

### Tables

| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text |

```
| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text |
```
It can also be slightly simplified, without the left and right pipes:

Unicode block | Font support
------------- | ------------
C0 Controls and Basic Latin|U+0020..U+007E
C1 Controls and Latin-1 Supplement|U+00A0..U+00FF

```
Unicode block | Font support
------------- | ------------
C0 Controls and Basic Latin|U+0020..U+007E
C1 Controls and Latin-1 Supplement|U+00A0..U+00FF
```

When text requires wrapping in cells, the relative width of columns can be somewhat adjusted by tweaking the `--- | ---` line under the header:

Unicode block | Characters | Long explanation
------------- | ---- | -----------------------------
C0 Controls and Basic Latin|U+0020..U+007E|This is a longer text to describe the basic Latin block
C1 Controls and Latin-1 Supplement|U+00A0..U+00FF|

```
Unicode block | Characters | Long explanation
------------- | ---- | -----------------------------
C0 Controls and Basic Latin|U+0020..U+007E|This is a longer text to describe the basic Latin block
C1 Controls and Latin-1 Supplement|U+00A0..U+00FF|
```

Table columns can also be aligned using `:---:` syntax.

Left-aligned | Centered | Right-aligned 
:------------- | :------------: | -------------:
This is a longer text to describe the basic Latin block|C0 Controls and Basic Latin|U+0020..U+007E
More left-aligned text|C1 Controls and Latin-1 Supplement|U+00A0..U+00FF

```

```

### Images

#### Image location, filenames, and size

Images used on a page should be placed in an `images` folder in the same location as the page, typically within a main topic (collection). They should normally be .png or .jpg. Other formats may work but are untested.

Image filenames should follow the format `pppp[-n]-shortname.png` where

- _pppp_ is the topic page number (suggestion not an absolute requirement)
- _n_ is an optional counter if you have multiple images on a page
- _shortname_ can be whatever you want (it-can-even-have-multiple-hyphens) but should be all lowercase

There should be no spaces. Use hyphens, not underscores. The optional counter is not required and does not need to relate to any figure numbering.

If you want to reuse an image on multiple pages within the same topic name it with the topic number of one page and then reference it on another.

If you want to reuse an image from another topic you can either reference it directly using a relative path or copy and rename the file into the current topic images folder (as long as it's small).

Images can be any size, but those intended to fill the main content column should be at least 720 pixels wide, and any size above that can be used. Astro will adjust the size and optimize the image automatically. There is no need to manually optimize images for a particular size.

#### Image references

To place an image on a page use this format:

```![AltText](images/picname.png)```

Here is an example of an image reference:

![This is alt text](images/9800-full-image.png)

```
![This is alt text](images/9800-full-image.png)
```

You can also reference smaller images:

![This is alt text](images/9800-small-image.png)

```
![This is alt text](images/9800-small-image.png)
```

Or an external image:

![An illustration of planets and stars featuring the word “astro”](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withastro/docs/main/public/default-og-image.png)

```
![An illustration of planets and stars featuring the word “astro”](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withastro/docs/main/public/default-og-image.png)
```

Inline images are not supported.

Image references should not be broken over multiple lines. They may still work, however the Decap system does not support them.

There is currently no special support or styling for image captions, although it would be a nice addition. To add a caption add the caption text on the next line with no blank line in between.

### Links

_Note that link formats are not yet firm and may change depending on what decisions are made regarding general referencing._

It is generally preferred that links use named references. Rather than use the basic `[text](completefilereference)` format in text it is better to use `[text][refname]`, then define each `[refname]` on a separate line later in the document. _Note use of brackets rather than parentheses!_

For most shorter pages the reference definitions should be at the end of the page, but for longer docs such as [Writing Systems Best Practice][WSBP] the reference definitions could be clustered at the end of each section. They aren't rendered on the page so their location can vary.

Use the hash `#ai-use` to link to [another section on the same page][AI] (level 2 or 3).

Use `../filename` without the `.md` extension to link to [another page in the same topic][Glossary]. Yes, that's not quite a standard relative path!

Use an extended path link `../../topics/analysis/bidi` to link to [another page in another topic][Bidi]. Remember that some _topics_ are top level folders (guides, reference, etc.) and some are inside the `topics` folder (topics/analysis, topics/layout, topics/fonts)! Working out the proper extended path from the current file can be tricky.

Use a full URL for [external links][OTSpec].

[Glossary]: ../glossary
[Bidi]: ../../topics/analysis/bidi
[OTSpec]: https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/

### Blocks

Code blocks begin and end with three backticks ` ``` `. Syntax formatting including _Expressive Code_ features are available - see [Code blocks](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/#code-blocks).

> Blockquotes use a `>` at the start of each line.

### Footnotes

Here is an example of a footnote[^1] that will appear at the very bottom[^anytext] of the page. Footnotes will automatically be numbered sequentially when rendered.

[^1]: Here is an example of how the footnote text is indicated. This example reference is in the text.

[^anytext]: Footnote references can also be text but will still get numbered correctly. The references can be placed at the bottom of the markdown page.
