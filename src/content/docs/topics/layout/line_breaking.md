In typesetting the Latin script, text is [justified][glossary-justification] on a line by first seeing how much fits on a line, then checking to see if there is a word break there (for example, a space), next checking to see if a word can be broken (hyphenated) at that point, then adding space between words and finally (although strongly deprecated!) between letters to fill out the line.

Line breaking becomes more difficult if scripts do not have word breaks, as in Tibetan and Thai, or if the word break is represented by a character rather than a space, as with the [Ethiopic _Hulet Neteb_ (&#x1361;)][hyphenation]. See [Justification][justification] and [Hyphenation][hyphenation] for details on those aspects of line breaking.

There are three general methods used by applications to determine line breaking: character category based, hyphenation, and dictionary based.

## Character category based

- UAX#14 - Character category based
    - widely used via libicu
    - breaks based on character categories, e.g. punctuation, spaces
    - more concerned with where not to break than were to break (a good
      approach)
    - Sufficient for basic line breaking for all languages that use spaces as
      word breaks
    - using ZWSP to linebreak non word spaced text as if it were spaced

## Hyphenation

- Used in conjunction with character category based as a refinement
- Manual hyphenation via SHY

## Dictionary 

- How to break a string given a wordlist
    - Maximal matching
    - Perfect matching
        - `a+b?, b*c+d*, d+a*` matching `aabcda`: `aab|cd|a` or `aa|bc|da` or
            `aa|bcd|a` (need a better example)
            - Handling unknown text
    - Frequency weighed perfect matching
- Assumptions of language and dictionary based on script
    - How to stop those based on language tagging
    - How to mitigate them given poorly tagged text
        - What is the range of a ZWSP?
