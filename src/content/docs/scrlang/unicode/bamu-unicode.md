The Bamum script was encoded in The Unicode Standard version 5.2. Another block has subsequently been encoded. The script is encoded in the following blocks:

table:
Blocks|Character Range|Added in Unicode Version|Unicode Chart|
Bamum |A6AO..A6FF|5.2|{link:http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA6A0.pdf UA6A0.pdf}|
Bamum Supplement | 16800..16A3F | 6.0 | {link:http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U16800.pdf U16800.pdf}|
