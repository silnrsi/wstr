This comparison reveals a complex pattern of correlation between types of glosses, layout, titles of works, curricula and phases of education.","The layout features of the manuscripts from Borno and the wider Senegambia region were initially studied as part of the project 'Writing and reading paratexts in West African Islamic manuscripts: a comparative study of commentaries on Arabic texts in Old Kanembu and Old Mande' which subsequently developed into the project 'Islamic manuscripts with a wide spaced layout as mediators of teaching practices in West Africa', both projects being integrated into the collaborative research SFB 950 at the Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures, University of Hamburg.

When these languages are developed, the issue of script becomes very important. The Tibetan script has strong associations with the classical Tibetan language, and has been used primarily for writing Tibetan Buddhist religious works. As such, attitudes towards variation of its complex orthographic principles are quite conservative. In some regions (Tibet and Bhutan), the Tibetan orthography is clearly the preferable writing system for any written forms of these modern Tibetan languages.(CR)(CR)However, due to the conservative attitudes, adjusting the orthography to represent the reality of the modern languages can be a divisive exercise. In other regions where Tibetan-related languages are spoken (India, Nepal, and Pakistan), there are other scripts which may be considered in developing these modern Tibetan languages. Even in these situations the ethnolinguistic identity associated with the Tibetan script suggests that use of a modified Tibetan orthography is more acceptable than use of other scripts (though they may be more accessible). This article discusses some of the key issues involved in developing Tibetan languages in these multiscriptal environments, and gives examples from several such languages which are in varying stages of development.",A discussion of script choice among Tibetan-related languages.,journal,vn47cbwwjz,,International Journal of the Sociology of Language,1613-3668,,,,,,

Next, the issue of the basic unit of representation in the Mandarin mental lexicon is discussed, and the conclusion is reached that this unit is the word rather than the morpheme. A number of factors influencing visual access to compounds in languages in general and Mandarin in particular are identified, and empirical findings on these factors are summarized. The article concludes by examining the relationship between Chinese orthography and compound processing in Mandarin, and by identifying a number of issues which await discussion in future research.(CR)(CR)Please note that, in order to read this article, you must either purchase short-term access to it, or be a subscriber to the journal.",journal,gtszd6u89m,"Mandarin Chinese compounds, their representation, and processing in the visual modality",Writing Systems Research,,,2011,,,,

Yi is a member of the Yi Branch of the Lolo-Burmese subgroup of the Tibeto-Burman family (Benedict 1972/2009, Bradley 1979), which includes some 50 languages, also called the Nisoic languages (Lama 2012) or Ngwi Group. The large (5 million) ethnic Yi nationality groups of Yunnan Province are distantly related. The third author, Lama Ziwo, who was 31 at the time of recording, produced, translated and transcribed the recorded audio data phonemically and participated in the laryngoscopic filming of the video data. He is a native speaker of the Suondip/Suondi dialect, and a fluent speaker of the Shypnra/Shengza dialect. It is the Shypnra/Shengza standard dialect that is being represented in this paper. The most distinguishing phonetic feature of Northern Yi is its systematic vocal register contrast (Matisoff 1972, Dai 1990) between two settings of the laryngeal constrictor mechanism, which are referred to as a lax (unconstricted) series and a tense (constricted) series (Edmondson et al. 2000, 2001). The contrast is realized as a distinction in resonance (spectral quality) rather than as contrasting phonation types as in some other forms of Yi or in other Tibeto-Burman languages (e.g. Bai). The consonantal inventory is large, with complex vocalic interactions, including interactions with two pairs of fricativized vowels. Northern Yi has 43 initial consonants, five pairs of vowels (or syllable rhymes), and three tones: 55, 33, and 21. Relevant reports on voice quality in related languages can be found in Maddieson and Ladefoged (1985) and Sun and Liu (1986).",Detailed study of phonetics for the standard Sichuan Yi language variety.,journal,fgajf6u6yf,Nuosu Yi (Journal of the IPA),Journal of the International Phonetic Association,0025-1003,,April 2017,,,,

The history of script choice among the Miao in China presents a microcosm encompassing most of the relevant factors for script choice listed by Unseth, and this gives ample opportunities for studying this phenomenon in settings that share some common traits including geography, ethnic composition, historical development, and a political system. Factors explaining the relative success of the many scripts devised for various varieties of Miao are explored. The general decreasing use of Miao scripts during the last decades must also be viewed within the context of increasing assimilation and China's rapid changes.",Discussion of the various writing systems used by the Miao.,journal,am7gfjyyru,,International Journal of the Sociology of Language,1613-3668,,,,,,

The two Japanese kana—hiragana and katakana—do not represent individual segments, but they too notate mora count by giving long vowels two signs and by using signs for syllable-final consonants. In both languages, the kinds of consonants that can occur syllable finally are severely restricted. It is the presence or absence of such a consonant, rather than the identity of the consonant, that is important. Using a writing system that represents mora count thus makes sense in both languages. Yet Thaana and the two kana otherwise work on different principles, so it is not adequate to call them simply moraic writing systems. This prompts an expansion of the inventory of script types: Thaana is a moraic alphabet and the kana are moraic syllabaries.","This article explores the way in which Maldivian Thaana and Japanese kana represent the mora count of syllables, and proposes an expansion of the inventory of script types to include moraic alphabets and moraic syllabaries.",journal,sf6bdnv34e,"Maldivian Thaana, Japanese kana, and the representation of moras in writing",Writing Systems Research,,,2012,,,,

One is Ligature based approach and other is character based. Both approaches have their own limitations. The most dominating solution is ligature based Nori Nastaleeq font. But this font can only be run in proprietary software InPage®. And this software can only be run in a MS Windows environment. The other promising solution is character based Nafees Nastaleeq font. This font uses OpenType® technology to generate ligatures. OpenType® solution is very slow for Nastaleeq script and has limitations for proportional spacing and justification.(CR)(CR)TeX is a revolutionary typesetting system developed by Donald Knuth in 1980s. It is a defecto standard for many scientific and mathematic publications. TeX was mainly aimed at typesetting mathematics and English text. Omega is an extension of TeX developed by John Plaice and Yannis Haralambous. Its first release, aims primarily at improving TeX's multilingual abilities. Omega allows multiple inputs and output character sets, and uses programmable filters to translate from one encoding to another, to perform contextual analysis. The pixel level control of TeX over glyphs and filtering approach of Omega suits them best for complex scripts like Nastaleeq.",This thesis goes into great detail about how the Nastaleeq style of Arabic script works.

In the study, native Hindi speakers were asked to delete the first consonant in a syllable (the onset consonant) from two pairs of invented ""words"". In the first word the spatial ordering was aligned to the phonological ordering - that is, each character followed the previous one in the same order as they would be spoken - but in the second word a character which is subject to reordering was used, so that the spatial ordering was incongruous with the phonological ordering. The results strongly support the hypothesis that the spatial order of the phonemes influences segmental awareness in languages that are written with an abugida.(CR)(CR)Please note that, to view the full article, you will need either to be a subscriber to the journal or to purchase short-term access to the article.",journal,gulbptpweg,Impact of spatial ordering of graphemes in alphasyllabic scripts on phonemic awareness in Indic languages,Writing Systems Research,,,2010,,,,

The role it plays in our everyday lives in most modern societies is so vital that it is almost impossible to overstate its relevance. Indeed, when trying to imagine what one’s days would look like without writing, one will likely soon realise that in literate communities, life without literacy appears almost unthinkable. As a mode of communication fundamentally different from speech, writing fulfils numerous functions. Many of these have developed only in the recent past, which led to a noticeable increase of contexts in which writing is used. Due to digitalisation, for example, writing has become a very convenient and easy way of communicating. As its use in messenger services and social media shows, it is strikingly flexible with respect to degrees of formality and registers. At the same time, it is also a deeply personal and social matter as individuals and even entire cultures use it to convey their identities – be it through the choice of a specific script (such as the Roman script), the appearance of one’s handwriting in different contexts (e.g., on a shopping list vs. in a handwritten letter to a friend), the use of a specific typeface when designing a document, or the decision to obey or disobey orthographic norms, to mention only a few examples. These underline that virtually every conscious and also unconscious choice made in writing is a form of social action.(CR)(CR)It is precisely for this reason that many people perceive writing as a skill intimately tied to themselves, so much so that it could be argued that in literate communities, writing is regarded as a common good. It is to be expected, then, that matters concerning writing potentially result in heated debates. Take as examples discussions surrounding spelling reforms, the abolishment of cursive handwriting in early literacy instruction, or the question of whether certain emojis count as written words and lead to a decay of writing. Against this background, it is undeniable that writing has ceased to stand in the shadow of speech. It is obviously no longer the conservative technique reserved for scribes of the elite that it had been in ancient societies. Instead, it is now firmly established as an integral part of many lives. As such, it has also gained relevance as a subject of research, leading to the necessity and emergence of a field devoted to it.",An Overview of Grapholinguistics,book,m6fktetnj3,Writing Systems and Their Use (available as hardcover or free download),,978-3-11-075777-4,,2022,,,,

At the time of writing, there was a theory that the script was a degenerate relic of an ancient writing method from the Asiatic mainland or Easter Island. Reisenberg and Kaneshiro argue, however, for a partially Latin derivation, a Latin-based script having developed elsewhere in the region as a misunderstood response to brief instruction given by the castaway Alfred Snelling. This was not well-suited to the writing of Woleain, so was abandoned in favour of a second and wholly new syllabary which combined the signs used in Snelling's system with local environmental and cultural symbols.",journal,hjew8vwhuz,,Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin,,,1960,,,,

However, the author finds that the non-representation of tone in the orthography only accounts for a part of the problem. Hidden or unclear morpheme boundaries can have a greater effect, both in themselves and in the fact that they can further conceal tone by masking the roots of morphemes. The author suggests that, if the roots were made explicit, tone could be deduced to a much greater extent without having to be written.",journal,nqpm98q3u5,Hidden morpheme boundaries in Kabiye: A source of miscues in a toneless orthography,Writing Systems Research,,,2010,,,,

Silva,,Sliva,International Journal of the Sociology of Language,,,,,,2008,,,1613-3668,,,57-74,2008,192,"script-hang, lang-kor",,"Soon after their arrival to Korea, Christian missionaries were confronted by decisions regarding how they would present written materials to the Korean people. While many Koreans used their indigenous script (Hangeul) for everyday purposes, higher status literacy materials were expected to be presented using Chinese characters (Hanja), a system unfamiliar to most but considered more prestigious by all. In deciding to publish the majority of their materials in the more accessible but lower-status script, the missionaries contributed to a revaluation of Hangeul as a fully legitimate means of written communication in a broader range of functional domains.",An article on the revaluation of the Hangeul script.,journal,jjjpzf4pt9,,International Journal of the Sociology of Language,1613-3668,,,,,,

The article analyses the interaction between visibility and simplicity and its influence on orthographic forms. This interaction is represented by visual markers for vowel length and the restriction on the doubling of a vowel in German orthography, and by historical changes of letter shape and grapheme insertion in Korean orthography. The authors conclude that the interaction between visibility and simplicity results in two types of orthographic syllable in both German and Korean, and that these can be classified as either invisible or visible.

The complexity of Japanese writing overall is attributed to “indirect” language contact with languages encountered predominantly in written form, especially Literary Chinese in the past and English nowadays, to which the concept of “total availability” that R. A. Miller (1967) uses to characterize neologism in Japan is applied. Specific choices of script are described in terms of cultural stereotypes and Jakobson's (1960) functions of language. Advertising and manga are identified as the major sources of many nonconventional practices that then spread into youth writing and even popular fiction. In each point, there is a parallel between choices in spoken language and in script choice.",The complexity of Japanese writing is discussed in this article.,journal,uzaghhkyv8,,International Journal of the Sociology of Language,1613-3668,,,,,,

This paper examines the few cases in which a person from outside a language community devised a script for a previously unwritten language. In all of the cases studied, the outsiders who devised scripts for the language communities were Christian missionaries. Among the eight cases are several common factors, and in all the cases, devising something unique for the community (rather than introducing something from the missionaries' own culture) was part of a successful strategy for church planting within these groups.",A journal article on several scripts that were initially devised by Christian Missionaries.,journal,jsgutx8n36,Missiology: An International Review (access through subscription only),Missiology,,,July 2008,,,,

The symbols correspond to phonemic syllables as spoken in the Shengzha variety of Northern Yi. Aspiring readers of Nuosu Yi text must memorize this sound-symbol correspondence. Studies across languages and writing systems have shown that early study of frequently used symbols can speed learning progress. (Dale and Chall 1948; Hu and Catts 1998; Johnson, Smith, and Jensen 1972)(CR)(CR)While software exists for doing corpus-based analysis of Yi language data (Chen 2010; 2011), until now the literature lacked an ordered list of frequently used Nuosu syllables. This study lists Nuosu Yi syllables in order of their frequency of occurrence in a body of text. The corpus includes nine texts, containing a total of 23,536 syllables. In the sample, 783 unique syllables occurred at least once. The cumulative usage data show that a person with reading knowledge of 402 symbols (of the available 1,165) could have read 95% of our text sample. The Nuosu Yi syllable frequency data are also compared with Mandarin Chinese syllable frequency (Sung 2005).","List of Nuosu Yi syllables by frequency, with analysis and comparison to similar data for Mandarin Chinese syllables.",academic,egbfr5km4e,,,,presentation,"February, 2015",,,,

N'ko presents a rare example of an indigenous script that has successfully competed against other writing systems that are older, better financed, and propagated in religious and formal education. N'ko script is studied in relation to its role as one of the most popular and widespread indigenous scripts in contemporary West Africa. The social relevance of N'ko literacy is contrasted with colonial and national literacy education programs. N'ko's popularity is shown to result from the script's strong linguistic and cultural relevance to Mande communities through its faithful transcription of local languages and its corpus of publications on indigenous and foreign knowledge. The introduction of formal schooling in N'ko is analyzed as a significant recent shift in the literacy movement that presents new opportunities and challenges. The internationalization of the movement is shown to have strengthened support for N'ko literacy, with N'ko serving as an important contemporary symbol of Mande social identity, which the author terms its “social orthography.” However, N'ko's strong association with Mande identity also threatens to limit the literacy movement's future development.(CR)(CR)The article is available for purchase via the link above.",An article on the N'ko script and its usage.,journal,a3ltgxgwud,,International Journal of the Sociology of Language,1613-3668,,,,,,
