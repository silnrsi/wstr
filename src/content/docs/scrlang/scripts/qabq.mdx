## Script description

The Badaga script is a relatively recent creation.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>It was developed over approximately 40 years by Yogesh Raj Kadasoley, and officially released in 2012. The script is designed for writing the Badaga language, a Dravidian language spoken in Tamil Nadu in South India. The Badaga people primarily worship the Hindu goddess Hethai.

Previously, the language was written in the Kannada script, and it is currently most often written in the Tamil script. 

This is not the first script designed exclusively for the Badaga language. In 2009, Anandhan Raju designed a Badaga script based on the shapes of Tamil characters.
