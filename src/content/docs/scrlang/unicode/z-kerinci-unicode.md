The Kerinci script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+15B40..U+15B6F in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard.

Two documents towards inclusion in Unicode have been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee:

- 2011-03-03 Indonesian and Philippine Scripts and extensions not yet encoded or proposed for encoding in Unicode — Christopher Miller ([L2/11-091](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/11-091))

- 2016-04-07 Preliminary proposal to encode the Kerinci script in Unicode — Anshuman Pandey ([L2/16-074](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/16-074))

  - _Recommendations to UTC #148 August 2016 on Script Proposals — Deborah Anderson, Ken Whistler, Rick McGowan, Roozbeh Pournader, Andrew Glass, Laurentiu Iancu, and Lisa Moore ([L2/16-216](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/16-216)) (See section 13 for recommendations)_
