[comment]: # (Placeholder: Basic summary and links to various resources and keyboard tools. Link to WSIG 7)

_This section has yet to be completed._
In the meantime see sections 7 to 7.4 of
[Guidelines for Writing System Support: Technical Details: Data Entry and Editing][wsig7].
Things have changed since section 7.5 of that document was written.
The following sections provide more recent information.

## Keyman

[Keyman][keyman] provides keyboarding solutions for Windows, Mac, and Linux computers
and also for Android and iOS touch devices (such as phones and tablets).
A Keyman keyboard package provides a remapping of the keys of the physical keyboard
(and optionally of touch devices),
as described in the [From keystrokes to codepoints][from-keystokes-to-codepoints] section.
The same keyboard package can be used on any supported platform
that has the Keyman "engine" for that platform installed.
There is no charge for using Keyman or for downloading keyboards from the Keyman site.

On the [Keyman][keyman] site, a user can type a language name into the search box
to see what existing keyboards support that language.
The user can, on the site, try the keyboard online and download a keyboard package to install.

If no suitable keyboard exists, a user can download the [Keyman Developer][keymandeveloper]
tool and create a suitable keyboard layout.
Users who create such a keyboard are encouraged to submit it to the Keyman keyboards repository
so that others can benefit from having that keyboard freely available.

## Other input methods

This [Keyboard Systems Overview article][ssart] was originally written in 2012 and updated in 2025.
It describes other keyboard input methods (and tries to indicate which ones are no longer viable).
In particular, one of the character picker options may be an acceptable solution
for typing rarely used characters.
