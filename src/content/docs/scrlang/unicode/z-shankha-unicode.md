The Shankha (Shell) script is not yet in Unicode, and no proposals have been submitted for including it in Unicode. It is not yet in the Roadmap for the Unicode Standard. The [Script Encoding Initiative](https://sei.berkeley.edu/) includes this script in their list of “Scripts Not Yet Encoded”. Contributions here may support their efforts.
