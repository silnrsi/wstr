The logographic script of Pau Cin Hau was created to write the Tedim language spoken in Myanmar.

<summary>Read the full description...'</summary>Specifically, it was created to convey the teachings of Pau Cin Hau, a Tedim speaker who founded the Laipian religion. According to Pau Cin Hau, he had a dream in 1902 in which the script was revealed to him. In 1932 the script was revised and the repertoire of approximately 1,000 logographs was reduced to fifty-seven alphabetic letters to form the [Pau Cin Hau Alphabet](/scrlang/script-pauc).
