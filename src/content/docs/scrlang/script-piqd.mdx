## Script description

The Klingon language was originally created to add realism to a race of fictional aliens who inhabit the world of Star Trek, an American television and movie franchise.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>_KLI pIqaD_ is the orthography advocated for use by the Klingon speaking community. This script is designed to emulate Klingon writing seen on the television show. Because of the difficulty involved in learning a new script, the Latin alphabet is used by some enthusiasts to write Klingon.

Klingon (KLI pIqaD) has an alphabet of 26 characters with a one-to-one grapheme-phoneme correspondence. There are ten numerals in the set. It is written left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Punctuation appears to be only used in Latin transliteration.
