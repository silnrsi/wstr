## Script description

The Lycian alphabet was used during the 5th to 3rd centuries BC for writing the Lycian language, an Indo-European language spoken in what is now Southern Turkey.

There were twenty-nine letters in the Lycian script, six representing vowels and twenty-three representing consonants and semi-vowels.

<summary>Read the full description...'</summary>The shapes of the letters were based on those of the archaic Greek alphabet, but visually similar letters did not necessarily represent the same sounds in both scripts.

Lycian was almost always written from left to right, although there are some examples in which it was written from right to left. Spaces were not left between words, but a two-dot word divider was often used.
