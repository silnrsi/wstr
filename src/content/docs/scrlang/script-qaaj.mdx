## Script description

Lahnda (also Landa) was a Brahmi-derived script used in the Punjab and Sindh regions of what are now India and Pakistan from around the 10th to the early 20th centuries.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...'</summary>The script was known as a merchants' script, although it was also used for literature and administrative purposes. Despite being widely used, Lahnda was never standardized, nor its regional variants unified, so there is significant variation in the styles used in different areas. The many varieties are sometimes classified into two broad groups, 'Punjabi' and 'Sindhi'. <br />
The script has now been supplanted by Arabic and Devanagari writing, although its successor, the Gurmukhi script, is widely used throughout the Punjab.
