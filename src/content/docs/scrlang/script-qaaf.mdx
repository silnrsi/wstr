## Script description

The Duota script is used by the Khmu people in Jinghong, Laos, for writing their language.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...'</summary>The script is also used in China, where the Khmu population is relatively small and isolated. The language is also spoken in other parts of Laos, where it is written in the Laotian script, and in  Vietnam, Myanmar and Thailand, where it is written in the Latin script. Speakers in Mengla, on the China/Laos border do not apply any script to the language. There have been experimental attempts in Thailand to apply the Thai script to Khmu phonology.
