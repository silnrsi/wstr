    "Ajami was the language of scholarship in Kanem Borno, through which religious knowledge is imparted to students.Therefore, Ajamization was in place even before the coming of the Europeans to the Kanem land. Ajami is not used for language of  scholarship and skill acquisition only but it serves enormous roles in adult education, political education as well as mass literacy in general. It also serves as a medium for integration of Qur'anic education into formal western type of education. So that  product of Qur'anic education can be elected into various political offices. They too can contribute in political administration and  governance of their nations. Against this backdrop, this paper reviews various Ajami writing system among the Kanuri speaking communities with a view to harmonise the divergent spellings and writing practices."

    "Previous research has suggested that reading Arabic is slower than reading Hebrew or English, even among native Arabic readers. The authors of this article tested the hypothesis that part of the difficulty in reading Arabic is due to the visual complexity of Arabic orthography. The findings support a perceptual load account of the source of processing difficulty in reading Arabic. In the article, the authors first explain some of the complexities of Arabic writing, then describe the methods they used to test their hypothesis, and finally discuss their findings. Please note that you need to either be a subscriber to this journal, or purchase short term access to this article, in order to read it."

Due to the cursive nature of Arabic writing, text justification in Arabic has a quite different logic. So, the classical algorithms of text justification must be completely revised. Justification in Arabic typography has traditional processes inspired by calligraphy manuals. Words are flexible: on the one hand, a word can be resized through stretching some letters in a curvilinear way; on the other hand, it can be shrunk via ligatures so that the width of a given letter group is decreased."

The introduction of romanized primers in Cham schools brought much opposition, and in the 1970s they chose to revert to the traditional script for their language. In so doing, the Eastern Cham people revealed that their script is important visible evidence of their distinctiveness as a unique people."

    "There is a distinctive type of manuscripts across the whole of West Africa characterised by ample space between the lines. This codicological feature seems to point to teaching practices wherein extra space is planned for annotations. This article attempts to draw a correlation between this specific layout and the content of the manuscripts, thus demonstrating that practices of Islamic education can be deduced from analysis of manuscript production. Following Introduction, section 2 discusses ample space layout relation to annotations in the Borno Quran manu-scripts; section 3 focuses on the same features in manuscripts from Borno, other than Quran manuscripts; section 4 is a comparative survey of the Borno, Senegam-bia and Adamawa manuscripts in terms of the relationship between the types of texts and the ample-spaced layout. This comparison reveals a complex pattern of correlation between types of glosses, layout, titles of works, curricula and phases of education."

    "The layout features of the manuscripts from Borno and the wider Senegambia region were initially studied as part of the project 'Writing and reading paratexts in West African Islamic manuscripts: a comparative study of commentaries on Arabic texts in Old Kanembu and Old Mande' which subsequently developed into the project 'Islamic manuscripts with a wide spaced layout as mediators of teaching practices in West Africa', both projects being integrated into the collaborative research SFB 950 at the Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures, University of Hamburg. The manuscripts originating from Hausa and Fulfulde speaking scholarly milieus in what is now north and east Nigeria are the subject of a preliminary study affiliated to the 'Wide space layout project' and conducted by Musa Salih Muhammad, Arewa House, and myself."

While research on the origins and history of the Arabic calligraphic scripts of the Central Sudan still needs to answer many questions, this article contends that, instead of focusing only on the few available sixteenth- or seventeenth- century manuscripts, researchers could also beneﬁt from the study of the easily accessible twentieth- century Nigerian calligraphic hands, which have inherited and popularized more ancient calligraphic traditions."

The spelling of this suffixal inflection is a major difficulty of French orthography, because many alternative spellings are available. The article presents the findings of a study carried out among 621 8- to 14-year-old children and confirms a very long and costly acquisition of the spelling skill. The author suggests that the French writing system is one of the most difficult to master. The study is intended to contribute to educational reform in France.(CR)(CR)Please note that, in order to read this article, you must either purchase short-term access to it, or be a subscriber to the journal."

    "Written development of Tibetan-related languages has seen an increase in recent years. When these languages are developed, the issue of script becomes very important. The Tibetan script has strong associations with the classical Tibetan language, and has been used primarily for writing Tibetan Buddhist religious works. As such, attitudes towards variation of its complex orthographic principles are quite conservative. In some regions (Tibet and Bhutan), the Tibetan orthography is clearly the preferable writing system for any written forms of these modern Tibetan languages.(CR)(CR)However, due to the conservative attitudes, adjusting the orthography to represent the reality of the modern languages can be a divisive exercise. In other regions where Tibetan-related languages are spoken (India, Nepal, and Pakistan), there are other scripts which may be considered in developing these modern Tibetan languages. Even in these situations the ethnolinguistic identity associated with the Tibetan script suggests that use of a modified Tibetan orthography is more acceptable than use of other scripts (though they may be more accessible). This article discusses some of the key issues involved in developing Tibetan languages in these multiscriptal environments, and gives examples from several such languages which are in varying stages of development."

    "This is the homepage of the Arrow-Headed Script Project at Philipps-Universität Marlburg. The project was launched in October 2004 to revive interest in and study of the few surviving documents written in this script. The first part of the Project ended in February 2007 with the successful completion of the work on the unique manuscript of Sarvarakṣita’s Maṇicūḍajātaka, a poem written in an interesting mixture of Sanskrit and a special kind of Prakrit. Since March 2007 Dr Dragomir Dimitrov has been in charge of the second part of the Project which focuses on a fragmentary codex unicus of the Candrālaṃkāra. This codex is hoped to provide a better understanding of the poorly recorded Bhaikṣukī script as used by Buddhist scholars in the twelfth century in Northern India, and to provide a fresh impulse for more intensive work on the Buddhist grammatical tradition."

    "For centuries, Swahili was written in Arabic script, and hundreds of manuscripts in collections around the world testify to its long tradition of written literature. Over the last century, however, Swahili in Roman script has become the norm. Andika! (meaning Write! in Swahili) has two aims. The first is to make Swahili in Arabic script as easy to use as Swahili in Roman script – it is equally easy to read and write the the language in either script.The tools, based on the work of Marehemu Mu’allim Sheikh Yahya Ali Omar (Omar and Frankl,1997) provide a consistent, standardised transliteration of Swahili in Arabic script, and a one-to-one mapping of this to Swahili in Roman script. Documents can be typed in either script, and automatically transliterated to the other."

    "This article reviews a number of key linguistic and psycholinguistic findings pertaining to Mandarin Chinese compound words, their representation, and their processing in the visual modality. The article begins with a linguistic overview of Mandarin compounds. Next, the issue of the basic unit of representation in the Mandarin mental lexicon is discussed, and the conclusion is reached that this unit is the word rather than the morpheme. A number of factors influencing visual access to compounds in languages in general and Mandarin in particular are identified, and empirical findings on these factors are summarized. The article concludes by examining the relationship between Chinese orthography and compound processing in Mandarin, and by identifying a number of issues which await discussion in future research.(CR)(CR)Please note that, in order to read this article, you must either purchase short-term access to it, or be a subscriber to the journal."

    "The Nuosu (Nosu) Yi language, or Northern Yi (北部彝语), is spoken by approximately two million people in southern Sichuan Province and northern Yunnan Province, China, the majority of whom are monolingual. Yi is a member of the Yi Branch of the Lolo-Burmese subgroup of the Tibeto-Burman family (Benedict 1972/2009, Bradley 1979), which includes some 50 languages, also called the Nisoic languages (Lama 2012) or Ngwi Group. The large (5 million) ethnic Yi nationality groups of Yunnan Province are distantly related. The third author, Lama Ziwo, who was 31 at the time of recording, produced, translated and transcribed the recorded audio data phonemically and participated in the laryngoscopic filming of the video data. He is a native speaker of the Suondip/Suondi dialect, and a fluent speaker of the Shypnra/Shengza dialect. It is the Shypnra/Shengza standard dialect that is being represented in this paper. The most distinguishing phonetic feature of Northern Yi is its systematic vocal register contrast (Matisoff 1972, Dai 1990) between two settings of the laryngeal constrictor mechanism, which are referred to as a lax (unconstricted) series and a tense (constricted) series (Edmondson et al. 2000, 2001). The contrast is realized as a distinction in resonance (spectral quality) rather than as contrasting phonation types as in some other forms of Yi or in other Tibeto-Burman languages (e.g. Bai). The consonantal inventory is large, with complex vocalic interactions, including interactions with two pairs of fricativized vowels. Northern Yi has 43 initial consonants, five pairs of vowels (or syllable rhymes), and three tones: 55, 33, and 21. Relevant reports on voice quality in related languages can be found in Maddieson and Ladefoged (1985) and Sun and Liu (1986)."

    "The present article aims at analyzing script choice among the Miao in China from the perspective of sociolinguistic aspects of script choice presented by Unseth (2005). The history of script choice among the Miao in China presents a microcosm encompassing most of the relevant factors for script choice listed by Unseth, and this gives ample opportunities for studying this phenomenon in settings that share some common traits including geography, ethnic composition, historical development, and a political system. Factors explaining the relative success of the many scripts devised for various varieties of Miao are explored. The general decreasing use of Miao scripts during the last decades must also be viewed within the context of increasing assimilation and China's rapid changes."

But this is not sufficient enough to preserve everything accurately, due to the lack of a script many incidents/ stories of the past has been lost and can never be recalled accurately. Keeping this problem in mind Prof. Banwang Losu developed the Wancho alphabet and counting system after working on it for more than 11 years. This project deals with bringing life to these alphabets by developing a typeface for the script in two weights so that it can be used in print medium."

    "Thaana, the script used to write the Maldivian language Dhivehi, represents the segments—the individual vowels and consonants—of the language but also notates the mora count of its syllables by assigning long vowels two vowel marks each and by using an absence-of-vowel mark on syllable-final consonants. The two Japanese kana—hiragana and katakana—do not represent individual segments, but they too notate mora count by giving long vowels two signs and by using signs for syllable-final consonants. In both languages, the kinds of consonants that can occur syllable finally are severely restricted. It is the presence or absence of such a consonant, rather than the identity of the consonant, that is important. Using a writing system that represents mora count thus makes sense in both languages. Yet Thaana and the two kana otherwise work on different principles, so it is not adequate to call them simply moraic writing systems. This prompts an expansion of the inventory of script types: Thaana is a moraic alphabet and the kana are moraic syllabaries."

    "With the advent of multi-lingual concept in computer systems, different solution has been proposed and implemented. But most of these are not matured enough or has platform barriers. The most promising solutions are OpenType® by Microsoft and Adobe, and Apple Advanced Typography by Apple Inc. The OpenType® specifications are open source, in spite of that the support of OpenType® on different platforms is not mature and even not consistent among Microsoft and Adobe applications.(CR)(CR)Two different techniques have been adapted to digitize the Nastaleeq script. One is Ligature based approach and other is character based. Both approaches have their own limitations. The most dominating solution is ligature based Nori Nastaleeq font. But this font can only be run in proprietary software InPage®. And this software can only be run in a MS Windows environment. The other promising solution is character based Nafees Nastaleeq font. This font uses OpenType® technology to generate ligatures. OpenType® solution is very slow for Nastaleeq script and has limitations for proportional spacing and justification.(CR)(CR)TeX is a revolutionary typesetting system developed by Donald Knuth in 1980s. It is a defecto standard for many scientific and mathematic publications. TeX was mainly aimed at typesetting mathematics and English text. Omega is an extension of TeX developed by John Plaice and Yannis Haralambous. Its first release, aims primarily at improving TeX's multilingual abilities. Omega allows multiple inputs and output character sets, and uses programmable filters to translate from one encoding to another, to perform contextual analysis. The pixel level control of TeX over glyphs and filtering approach of Omega suits them best for complex scripts like Nastaleeq."

    "Urdu is the lingua franca as well as the national language of Pakistan. It is based on Arabic script, and Nastaleeq is its default writing style. The complexity of Nastaleeq makes it one of the world's most challenging writing styles. Nastaleeq has a strong contextual dependency. It is a cursive writing style and is written diagonally from right to left. The overlapping shapes make the nuqta (dots) and kerning problem even harder.(CR)(CR)With the advent of multilingual support in computer systems, different solutions have been proposed and implemented. But most of these are immature or platform-specific. This paper discusses the complexity of Nastaleeq and a solution that uses Omega as the typesetting engine for rendering Nastaleeq."

    "This is an English translation of a Chinese paper written in 1982 by Hongkai Sun. It was translated in 2008 and published in the Asian Highlands Perspectives journal. The article provides an overview and analysis of some of the features of the Ersu Shaba Pictographic Writing System. The view held by some linguists that the pictographs are simply a series of drawings, rather than a writing system, is contested and reasons given for its contestation. Finally, two sample texts in the script are analysed and translated."

    "This article introduces the reader to the sociolinguistic issues surrounding the adoption of a writing system for sign languages. Initially, some background on sign language and Deaf culture is presented, followed by a discussion of several alternatives for writing sign languages and how these alternatives have been used and/or adopted. Sign languages in most parts of the world compete with spoken languages (languages that have established written traditions), resulting in diglossia. Though many scholars who work with the deaf community have tried to develop ways to write sign language(s), many Deaf do not feel the need for a writing system, either because they use video media or because they see writing as best done in the dominant language in their diglossic situation."

    "This article presents a study based on the Devanagari script, to examine how segmental awareness is influenced by the alignment of the spatial ordering of graphemes in relation to the logical phonological order of the phonemes. In the study, native Hindi speakers were asked to delete the first consonant in a syllable (the onset consonant) from two pairs of invented \"words\". In the first word the spatial ordering was aligned to the phonological ordering - that is, each character followed the previous one in the same order as they would be spoken - but in the second word a character which is subject to reordering was used, so that the spatial ordering was incongruous with the phonological ordering. The results strongly support the hypothesis that the spatial order of the phonemes influences segmental awareness in languages that are written with an abugida.(CR)(CR)Please note that, to view the full article, you will need either to be a subscriber to the journal or to purchase short-term access to the article."

    "This article describes a study which was carried out to determine how tone awareness contributes to reading at the intermediate level of primary schooling, and examine the relationship between tone awareness and pinyin instruction, a demonstrated booster for phonological awareness in Chinese children. The subjects of the study were 8- to 9-year-old children in Mainland China. The article describes the way in which the study was carried out, explains the data gathered during the course of the study, and discusses the evidence presented for the critical role of tone awareness in Chinese reading in intermediate-level primary school children."

    "This article discusses a study investigating young Chinese children’s development of orthographic processing and the factors that contribute to development. The investigation was carried out in both China and Canada to examine the effect of language learning contexts on the development of orthographic processing. The children's Chinese and English orthographic discrimination, radical position awareness, phonological awareness, character reading, and rapid digit naming were tested twice, about one year apart, and the results were compared. The article concludes from the results of the study that the language learning environment has a significant impact on the development of orthographic processing.

    "Writing is a cultural technology that has changed humankind by shaping the way we think and the way we communicate. The role it plays in our everyday lives in most modern societies is so vital that it is almost impossible to overstate its relevance. Indeed, when trying to imagine what one’s days would look like without writing, one will likely soon realise that in literate communities, life without literacy appears almost unthinkable. As a mode of communication fundamentally different from speech, writing fulfils numerous functions. Many of these have developed only in the recent past, which led to a noticeable increase of contexts in which writing is used. Due to digitalisation, for example, writing has become a very convenient and easy way of communicating. As its use in messenger services and social media shows, it is strikingly flexible with respect to degrees of formality and registers. At the same time, it is also a deeply personal and social matter as individuals and even entire cultures use it to convey their identities – be it through the choice of a specific script (such as the Roman script), the appearance of one’s handwriting in different contexts (e.g., on a shopping list vs. in a handwritten letter to a friend), the use of a specific typeface when designing a document, or the decision to obey or disobey orthographic norms, to mention only a few examples. These underline that virtually every conscious and also unconscious choice made in writing is a form of social action.(CR)(CR)It is precisely for this reason that many people perceive writing as a skill intimately tied to themselves, so much so that it could be argued that in literate communities, writing is regarded as a common good. It is to be expected, then, that matters concerning writing potentially result in heated debates. Take as examples discussions surrounding spelling reforms, the abolishment of cursive handwriting in early literacy instruction, or the question of whether certain emojis count as written words and lead to a decay of writing. Against this background, it is undeniable that writing has ceased to stand in the shadow of speech. It is obviously no longer the conservative technique reserved for scribes of the elite that it had been in ancient societies. Instead, it is now firmly established as an integral part of many lives. As such, it has also gained relevance as a subject of research, leading to the necessity and emergence of a field devoted to it."

With the aim of presenting a comparative orthographic analysis of the three languages, graphemic representations of the consonants are systematically compared and contrasted, followed by a similar analysis of the vowels. Similarities and differences between the three systems are summarized in tabular form. The comparative analysis presented here may inform computational studies of Persian, Urdu, and Pashto orthography and facilitate the teaching of reading and writing in these languages, particularly among second language learners."

It has also been used to transliterate Sanskrit and Chinese. The Tibetan writing system was based on a North Indian form of the Brahmi script and is said to have been developed to bring Buddhism from India to Tibet. Two distinctive styles have emerged: a formal style used for books and inscriptions (called dbu can ‘with a head’) and a cursive or calligraphic style (dbu med ‘acephalous’) commonly used in hand-written contexts. Tibetan script is a parent script of Phags-pa, Limbu, and Lepcha, which have separate encodings and shaping requirements."

    "The Arabic script in Africa contains sixteen papers on the past and present use of Arabic script to write African languages. These writing traditions, which are sometimes collectively referred to as Ajami, are discussed for single or multiple languages, with examples from all major linguistic phyla of Africa but one (Khoisan), and from all geographic areas of Africa (North, West, Central, East, and South Africa), as well as a paper on the Ajami heritage in the Americas. The papers analyze (ethno-) historical, literary, (socio-) linguistic, and in particular grammatological aspects of these previously understudied writing traditions and exemplify their range and scope, providing new data for the comparative study of writing systems, literacy in Africa, and the history of (Islam in) Africa."

    "In this article, the authors discuss the ability of a group of Kannada-speaking school children to dissect the orthographic syllable (or akshara) into its phonetic consonant and vowel segments. Although Kannada has generally been considered a fairly transparent writing system, the children (who had been taught to read the akshara as a single unit) had difficulty distinguishing the symbols for phonologically similar consonants, and were confused by some of the diacritics. The study suggests that previous understanding of writing system acquisition may have missed certain factors that contribute to the ease or difficulty with which a writing system is learned."

    "This paper is one of the most widely-quoted in material concerning the history of the Woleai script. At the time of writing, there was a theory that the script was a degenerate relic of an ancient writing method from the Asiatic mainland or Easter Island. Reisenberg and Kaneshiro argue, however, for a partially Latin derivation, a Latin-based script having developed elsewhere in the region as a misunderstood response to brief instruction given by the castaway Alfred Snelling. This was not well-suited to the writing of Woleain, so was abandoned in favour of a second and wholly new syllabary which combined the signs used in Snelling's system with local environmental and cultural symbols."

    "This article uses the example of Kabiye, one of the national languages of Togo, to illustrate the way in which miscues (errors in reading) can be a result of a toneless orthography being applied to a tone language. However, the author finds that the non-representation of tone in the orthography only accounts for a part of the problem. Hidden or unclear morpheme boundaries can have a greater effect, both in themselves and in the fact that they can further conceal tone by masking the roots of morphemes. The author suggests that, if the roots were made explicit, tone could be deduced to a much greater extent without having to be written."

    "Plains Cree is a less-resourced language in Canada. To promote its usage online, we describe previous keyboard layouts for typing Plains Cree syllabics on smartphones. We describe our own solution whose development was guided by ergonomics research and corpus statistics. We then describe a case study in which three participants used a previous layout and our own, and we collected quantitative and qualitative data. We conclude that, despite observing accuracy improvements in user testing, introducing a brand new paradigm for typing Plains Cree syllabics may not be ideal for the community."

In deciding to publish the majority of their materials in the more accessible but lower-status script, the missionaries contributed to a revaluation of Hangeul as a fully legitimate means of written communication in a broader range of functional domains."

    "This article is based on the linguistic theory of optimality, which proposes that language forms come about as a result of interactions between conflicting constraints. The article analyses the interaction between visibility and simplicity and its influence on orthographic forms. This interaction is represented by visual markers for vowel length and the restriction on the doubling of a vowel in German orthography, and by historical changes of letter shape and grapheme insertion in Korean orthography. The authors conclude that the interaction between visibility and simplicity results in two types of orthographic syllable in both German and Korean, and that these can be classified as either invisible or visible.

    "While he was engaged in a study of bilingualism among the Karen of western Thailand, the writer encountered three scripts which had been developed for Pwo Karen out of two writing systems closely related to each other, those of the Mon and the Burmese. The first is known as the \"Mission script\", the second is called \"Phu Ta Maik\" or \"Monastic script\" and the third system is closely related with the Leke sect, a millenarian Buddhist movement among the Karen. This third system is often called \"chicken-scratch writing\".(CR)(CR)Please note that this article can only be accessed from a library (or other institution) with a JSTOR subscription."

    "This article is taken from a talk about Hebrew Latinized type given at the 2004 Friends of St Bride Conference. It is an attempt to demonstrate why Latinized Hebrew type is problematic, both from cultural and functional aspects. The article provides an overview of the Hebrew script, and a comparison of Hebrew and Latin writing, followed by a discussion of the influence of Latin on Hebrew. This is attributed in part to globalization, and, in particular, what the author refers to as Israel's process of Americanization."

This article presents a study into the understanding of akshara (the orthographic unit of an alphasyllabary) in a group of Grade three children learning to read Malayalam. The study found that, by Grade three, the children had mastered independent vowels and consonants with inherent vowels. However, they did not have a good grasp of consonants with vowel diacritics and consonant clusters. These findings are discussed in the article in the context of similar studies in other alphasyllabaries and alphabetic orthographies.

    "The complexity and plurality of scripts and writing devices, such as auxiliary text or “ruby,” used in nonconventional writing in Japan are outlined, and various aspects, such as the use of loan scripts, are shown to parallel aspects of spoken language contact. The complexity of Japanese writing overall is attributed to “indirect” language contact with languages encountered predominantly in written form, especially Literary Chinese in the past and English nowadays, to which the concept of “total availability” that R. A. Miller (1967) uses to characterize neologism in Japan is applied. Specific choices of script are described in terms of cultural stereotypes and Jakobson's (1960) functions of language. Advertising and manga are identified as the major sources of many nonconventional practices that then spread into youth writing and even popular fiction. In each point, there is a parallel between choices in spoken language and in script choice."

This article presents a study in which second-graders, fifth-graders, and college students in Taiwan completed a word parsing task to test whether the length of time that a child has been literate has any bearing on their understanding of the concept of the metalinguistic term word. The study suggests that even second graders are aware of core properties of words, although the concept of word continues to develop as children acquire literacy experience.

This paper examines the few cases in which a person from outside a language community devised a script for a previously unwritten language. In all of the cases studied, the outsiders who devised scripts for the language communities were Christian missionaries. Among the eight cases are several common factors, and in all the cases, devising something unique for the community (rather than introducing something from the missionaries' own culture) was part of a successful strategy for church planting within these groups."

Of the approximately 80 million Vietnamese speakers worldwide, today fewer than 100 scholars can read Chữ Nôm. The VNPF is focused on two projects: the publication of the first Nôm dictionary (in true print and computer-accessible), and the provision of scholarships to students who wish to study with a Nôm scholar. This page provides details of the VNPF's work, as well as resources relating to the script, including a free Nôm font."

    "The standard written form of Nuosu Yi includes 1,165 symbols. The symbols correspond to phonemic syllables as spoken in the Shengzha variety of Northern Yi. Aspiring readers of Nuosu Yi text must memorize this sound-symbol correspondence. Studies across languages and writing systems have shown that early study of frequently used symbols can speed learning progress. (Dale and Chall 1948; Hu and Catts 1998; Johnson, Smith, and Jensen 1972)(CR)(CR)While software exists for doing corpus-based analysis of Yi language data (Chen 2010; 2011), until now the literature lacked an ordered list of frequently used Nuosu syllables. This study lists Nuosu Yi syllables in order of their frequency of occurrence in a body of text. The corpus includes nine texts, containing a total of 23,536 syllables. In the sample, 783 unique syllables occurred at least once. The cumulative usage data show that a person with reading knowledge of 402 symbols (of the available 1,165) could have read 95% of our text sample. The Nuosu Yi syllable frequency data are also compared with Mandarin Chinese syllable frequency (Sung 2005)."

    "DIN 31635 is a Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) standard for the transliteration of the Arabic alphabet adopted in 1982. It is based on the rules of the Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft (DMG) as modified by the International Orientalist Congress 1935 in Rome. The most important differences from English-based systems were doing away with j, because it stood for /dʒ/ in the English-speaking world and for /j/ in the German-speaking world and the entire absence of digraphs like th, dh, kh, gh, sh. Its acceptance relies less on its official status than on its elegance (one sign for each Arabic letter) and the Geschichte der arabischen Literatur manuscript catalogue of Carl Brockelmann and the dictionary of Hans Wehr. Today it is used in most German-language publications of Arabic and Islamic studies."

    "This article explores the development and spread of the N'ko script among Mande communities in West Africa. N'ko presents a rare example of an indigenous script that has successfully competed against other writing systems that are older, better financed, and propagated in religious and formal education. N'ko script is studied in relation to its role as one of the most popular and widespread indigenous scripts in contemporary West Africa. The social relevance of N'ko literacy is contrasted with colonial and national literacy education programs. N'ko's popularity is shown to result from the script's strong linguistic and cultural relevance to Mande communities through its faithful transcription of local languages and its corpus of publications on indigenous and foreign knowledge. The introduction of formal schooling in N'ko is analyzed as a significant recent shift in the literacy movement that presents new opportunities and challenges. The internationalization of the movement is shown to have strengthened support for N'ko literacy, with N'ko serving as an important contemporary symbol of Mande social identity, which the author terms its “social orthography.” However, N'ko's strong association with Mande identity also threatens to limit the literacy movement's future development.(CR)(CR)The article is available for purchase via the link above."

However, the linguistic analysis is based largely on the text of a play, the Parsuramopakhayana-nataka, which was written in the Newari script. The original text of the play is reprinted in the book, and is one of a few extant examples of the Newari script being applied to the Maithili language."
