## Script description

The Khotanese script and language were used in the kingdom of Khotan in the south-west of present-day Xinjiang, China.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>The Khotanese people were of Iranian descent and spoke an Indo-Iranian language.

Khotan lay along the Silk Road and was the first place outside of China (as China’s borders lay at that time) to begin cultivating silk. It was also a centre for the study and practice of Mahayana Buddhism. As a result, many languages including Chinese, Sanskrit, Prakrit and Tibetan were spoken there. Sanskrit and Prakrit were written in Khotan in a northern form of the [Brahmi](/scrlang/scripts/brah) script, called Gupta, from which the Khotanese script descended.

Khotanese is an abugida, similar in structure to [Tibetan](/scrlang/scripts/Tibt) with which it shares common origins. Characters were made up of a base radical with one or more vowel marks appended to it to change the quality of the following vowel from the “default” or inherent /a/ to either /i/, /u/ or /e/.
