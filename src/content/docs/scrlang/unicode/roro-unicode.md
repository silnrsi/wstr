The Rongorongo script is not yet in Unicode.  At one point the script had a tentative allocation in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. However, it is no longer in the roadmap.

## Blocks

None.

## Proposals and documents

A detailed proposal is not yet available. One document has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee:
