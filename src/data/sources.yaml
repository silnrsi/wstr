    Previous research has suggested that reading Arabic is slower than reading Hebrew or English,
    even among native Arabic readers. The authors of this article tested the hypothesis that part
    of the difficulty in reading Arabic is due to the visual complexity of Arabic orthography. The
    findings support a perceptual load account of the source of processing difficulty in reading
    Arabic. In the article, the authors first explain some of the complexities of Arabic writing,
    then describe the methods they used to test their hypothesis, and finally discuss their
    findings. Please note that you need to either be a subscriber to this journal, or purchase

  abstract: >-
    The Arabic script in Africa contains sixteen papers on the past and present use of Arabic
    script to write African languages. These writing traditions, which are sometimes collectively
    referred to as Ajami, are discussed for single or multiple languages, with examples from all
    major linguistic phyla of Africa but one (Khoisan), and from all geographic areas of Africa
    (North, West, Central, East, and South Africa), as well as a paper on the Ajami heritage in the
    Americas. The papers analyze (ethno-) historical, literary, (socio-) linguistic, and in
    particular grammatological aspects of these previously understudied writing traditions and
    exemplify their range and scope, providing new data for the comparative study of writing
    systems, literacy in Africa, and the history of (Islam in) Africa.
  annotation: >-
    This book is relevant for the history of knowledge and literacy in (Islamic) Africa, the
    linguistic study of writing systems (Grammatology), the socio-linguistics of writing, and
    orthography development and standardization.[CR][CR]A comprehensive review of this book is also
    available.
