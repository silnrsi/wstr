# .gitattributes template 
# Designed to tell git how to best deal with certain file formats 
# The goal for eols is to have LF in the repo and 
# LF in the working copy on all platforms.
# To tweak to your particular needs, 
# see http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes

# Windows users should use consider setting "core.autocrlf" to "input" and 
# "core.eol" to "lf" 
# to catch files that are not explicitly declared below.
# See http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config

# This causes git to auto detect text files
# which will have eol conversion applied according to core.autocrlf and core.eol 
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare the below matches to be text files, to keep LF eols when 
# writing to the working copy, and to convert CRLF to LF eols when adding to the repo.
# TODO: consider uncommenting the below line starting with [attr] and 
# removing "eol=lf" from the below lines
#[attr]text text eol=lf
