The Kaktovik numerals are not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+1D2C0..U+1D2DF in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. 

At least one document for its inclusion has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee:

- 2020-08-24 Request to move the tentative location of Kaktovik numerals on the roadmap — Eduardo Marín Silva ([L2/20-262](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/20-262))

  - _Recommendations to UTC #165 October 2020 on Script Proposals ([L2/20-250](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20250-script-adhoc-rept.pdf)) (See point 20.)_
