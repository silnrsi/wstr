A [grapheme][grapheme-def] is a unit of writing in a given language. There are a variety of more specific definitions of the term grapheme, but for the purposes of this site, the term "grapheme" is used to refer to a character or combination of characters that represent a sound, and therefore differs from a basic letter of the alphabet. You can think of a grapheme as a symbol that you need to learn in order to be able to read. In English, for instance, there are 26 letters of the alphabet, each of which is a grapheme. However, we also consider various combinations to be graphemes. For instance, the sequence "sh", representing the sound /ʃ/ as in 'shell', is a grapheme. A grapheme that consists of more than one character is called a multigraph.

The term [phoneme][phoneme-def] is well defined among linguists. It represents a distinctive sound as perceived by speakers of a language. Using English as an example again, there are subtle differences in how we pronounce the sound /t/, depending on what other sounds occur around it, or where it falls within a word. But each of those subtly different sounds is considered to be a "t sound"; in fact, native speakers are generally unaware of the differences. And so /t/ is a single phoneme (where the subtly different pronunciations are called allophones of the phoneme /t/).

Also note that every language has a different set of phonemes, depending on how native speakers perceive the sounds in the language. In English, the initial sounds in the words 'yam' and 'jam' correspond to different phonemes - /j/ and /dʒ/. In Spanish, however, they are both allophones of the same phoneme (at least in some dialects!).

Phonemes are identified by symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). To learn more, see our [introductory article on the IPA][ipa-article].

By convention, graphemes are written surrounded by angle brackets, and phonemes by slashes. So we would say that the grapheme ‹sh› represents the phoneme /ʃ/ in English.
