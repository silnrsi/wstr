Fonts are licensed for use through either proprietary or open font licenses.

Proprietary licenses are usually unique to the font developer or distributor and require some payment for use. Fees for use may be one-time or by subscription, and vary by what uses are allowed. Web fonts often have a completely different fee structure that may depend on the number of visitors. Proprietary licenses rarely allow any sort of modification.

Free and open font licenses require no payment for use, modification, or distribution. Although there are a few different open licenses that have been applied to fonts, the industry standard is the SIL Open Font License (OFL). For more information see the [SIL Open Font License (OFL) site][ofl].
