<summary>Read the full description...'</summary>It is mainly used by the Shui religious priests (Shuishu masters) but it is also used for research and documentation. The script is sometimes even incorporated into needlework.

The Shui language contains forty-four consonants, eight vowels, eight diphthongs and eight tones. The characters in the Shuishu script consist of Chinese variants, primitive pictographs and abstract symbols. It is usually written vertically downward and then towards the left without punctuation.

Shuishu has close to 500 characters. Each Shuishu character basically expresses a concept and stands for a syllable.
