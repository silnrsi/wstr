The Fula Ba script is not yet in Unicode. The script has not yet been added to the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. 

One document that mentions the script has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and WG2:

- 2009-04-22 Report to JTC1 Chair and JTC1/SC2 Chair Regarding Resolution 34 on African Languages â€” Deborah Anderson ([WG2 N3641](https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n3641.pdf), [L2/09-285](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/09-285))
