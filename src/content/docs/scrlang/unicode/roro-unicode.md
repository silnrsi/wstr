The Rongorongo script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+1CA80..U+1CDBF in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard.

## Proposals and documents

A detailed proposal is not yet available. One document has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee:
- 1998-12-04 Preliminary Codechart for Rongorongo script â€” Michael Everson ([L2/99-070](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L1999/rongorongo.pdf))
