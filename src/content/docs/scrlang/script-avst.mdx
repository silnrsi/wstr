## Script description

The Avestan script was used from the 5th to the 13th century AD for writing the Avestan language, an Eastern Iranian language which is now only known from its use as the language of Zoroastrian religious texts called Avesta, although it is thought that at one time it was probably a natural language in everyday use.
