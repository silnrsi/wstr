## Script features

<ScriptInfo />
## Script description

The Kirat Rai script is an abugida used for writing Bantawa, an eastern Kiranti language of the Sino-Tibetan family.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>Bantawa is spoken in Sikkim and Nepal by almost 400,000 people. The script appears to be a modification of [Khambu Rai](/scrlang/script-qa06), which is used for writing the same language.

Kirat Rai is written with thirty-one consonant letters each containing an inherent /a/ vowel, seven vowel diacritics for changing the inherent vowel, a virama for cancelling the inherent vowel, and a vowel carrier which can be used in combination with the vowel diacritics for writing word-initial vowels.
