The Stokoe Notation is not yet in Unicode. The script has not yet been added to the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. It may end up being unified with the Latin script.

## Blocks

None.

## Proposals and documents

One document discussing the script has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee:
- 2012-04-26 Towards a Unicode encoding for Stokoe Notation â€” Lorna Priest ([L2/12-133](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/12-133))
