The sitelen pona script, for the Toki Pona constructed language, is not yet in Unicode. The script is not yet in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. 

Several documents towards its inclusion have been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and WG2:
- 2021-07-26 Toki Pona for Unicode — Gabriel Tellez ([L2/21-137](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/21-137))
- 2024-04-16 Preliminary proposal to encode sitelen pona in the UCS — Sitelen Pona Working Group ([L2/24-275](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/24-275))
  - _Recommendations to UTC #182 January 2025 on Script Proposals ([L2/25-010](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/25-010)) (See point 6.6.)_
