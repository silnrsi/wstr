## Script details

<ScriptDetails />

## Script description

The classification "Symbols" is used for characters which do not belong to a language, and which do not fit another designation in the ISO 15924 standard such as 'Mathematical Notation', for example: arrows, card suit symbols, and religious icons.

## Languages that use this script

<WsList script='Zsym' wsMax='5' />

## Unicode status

In the Unicode Standard there are characters that are considered Symbols, but they are associated with certain scripts. The characters listed here are Symbols (Math_Symbol, Currency_Symbol, Modifier_Symbol, Other_Symbol), but they are in the "Common" category rather than associated with a particular script.
