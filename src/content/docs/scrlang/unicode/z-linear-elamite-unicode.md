The Linear Elamite script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+1C380..U+1C4FF in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. 

One preliminary proposal for its inclusion has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee:
- 2021-11-24 Preliminary proposal to encode Linear Elamite in Unicode â€” Anshuman Pandey ([L2/21-233](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/21-233))
  - _Recommendations to UTC #170 January 2022 on Script Proposals ([L2/22-023](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2022/22023-script-adhoc-rept.pdf)) (See point 7.)_
  - _UTC #170 Minutes ([L2/22-016](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2022/22016.htm)) (See D.1 SECTION 7 for decision and action items)_
