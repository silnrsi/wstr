In The Unicode Standard, Braille Patterns implementation is discussed in [Chapter 21: Notational Systems](https://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/core-spec/chapter-21/#G26597).

## Blocks

Braille Patterns were encoded in The Unicode Standard version 3.0. It is encoded in the following block:

| Blocks | Character Range | Added in Unicode Version | Documentation |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Braille Patterns  |  2800..28FF  |  3.0  |  [U2800.pdf](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2800.pdf)  |

## Proposals and documents

A number of proposals for its inclusion were submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and WG2 (most of the documents leading to the encoding of Braille do not appear to be online):
- 1998-03-23 Part 1:Architecture and Basic Multilingual Plane AMENDMENT 16: Braille Patterns — WG2 (N1770 (not online))
- 2003-09-20 Comments on proposed general category change for Braille symbols — Jack Maartman ([L2/03-335](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/03-335))
