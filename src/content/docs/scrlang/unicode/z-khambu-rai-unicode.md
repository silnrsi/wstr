The Khambu Rai script is not yet in Unicode. At one point the script had a tentative allocation in the [ Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. However, it is no longer in the roadmap. The Khambu Rai Unicode Proposal has now been superseded by the latest Kirat Rai Unicode Proposal (included below).

## Blocks

None.
