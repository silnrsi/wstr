The ZWJ (<Character usv="200D" options="usv,name"/>) and ZWNJ (<Character usv="200C" options="usv,name"/>) are
special format control characters that may be included in a character sequence
to impact the creation of ligatures. They are often referred to in the same
breath but they are treated somewhat differently when it comes to text
processing.

The general category of ZWJ and ZWNJ is format character (Cf). This implies that
they can be ignored for many processes like sorting and searching. But this is
not always the case. It depends on the process being applied and how that
interacts with the script of the text. For example, in Indic scripts, ZWJ and
ZWNJ are merely guides to fonts as to how to create conjuncts, whereas in Khmer
they are part of the spelling of a word since they control whether a shifter is
downshifted or not. For the most part it is advisable not to ignore them unless
you are looking for a relaxed matching scheme.

## Opentype

Since the handling of ZWJ and ZWNJ are somewhat script dependent the rules as to
whether they are ignored or not are somewhat complex. Details are only given for
[Harfbuzz][shaping-and-rendering] since most shapers are closed source and not well enough documented in
this area.

### Harfbuzz

In [Harfbuzz][shaping-and-rendering], ZWJ influences ligation while ZWNJ inhibits it. Thus in GPOS ZWNJ
is always ignored, even if the table implies otherwise, while ZWJ is treated the same as it is in GSUB.
In GSUB. Harbuzz has two modes in which it scans glyphs. The first is when matching for
replacement and the second is when matching a context string. The basic
treatment is:

| Character | Replacement | Context  |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| ZWJ       | Ignore      | Keep     |
| ZWNJ      | Keep        | Ignore   |

Characters which are to be ignored are not ignored and are kept in the
following feature contexts:

| Shaper  | Features                                     | Notes     |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------| --------- |
| Khmr    | pref, blwf, abvf, pstf, cfar, pres, abvs, blws, psts |  |
| Indic   | * | |
| Arab    | ccmp, locl, rlig, calt, liga, clig, cswh, mset | ZWJ only |
| [USE][glo-use]     | akhn, rphf, pref, rkrf, abvf, blwf, half, pstf, vatu, cjct, abvs, blws,
haln, pres, psts | ZWJ only |
| *       | mark, mkmk | ZWJ only |
