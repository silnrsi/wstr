Many of the pages on this site will reference different standards. Below we list links to the various standards mentioned.

## Encoding

[ISO/IEC 10646](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Coded_Character_Set) specifies the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS). It is intended to have the exact repertoire as is in The Unicode Standard. 

[The Unicode Standard](https://www.unicode.org/main.html) -- the standards body for the internationalization of software and services. 

## Languages

[ISO 639](http://www.infoterm.info/standardization/iso_639_1_2002.php) -- Code for individual languages and language groups.

[ISO 639-3](https://iso639-3.sil.org/) -- ISO 639 gives comprehensive provisions for the identification and assignment of language identifiers to individual languages, and for the creation of new language code elements or for the modification of existing ones.

[ROLV (Registry Of Language Varieties)](https://globalrecordings.net/en/rolv) -- This registry defines standardized codes used for identifying the language varieties (sometimes called dialects) of the world.

## Scripts

[ISO 15924](https://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html) -- ISO has appointed the Unicode Consortium as the Registration Authority for International Standard, _Codes for the representation of names of scripts_. These script codes are used in language tagging.

## Regions

[ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes) -- two-letter country codes are used in making a language tag.

[ISO 3166-1 Numeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_numeric) -- three-digit region codes are sometimes used when a country code is insufficient.

## Writing system support

[BCP 47 / IANA Language Subtag Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) -- A BCP 47 tag is a standard way of referencing a language, used widely in the computer industry. The tag structure has been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in Best Current Practice (BCP) 47; the subtags are maintained by the IANA Language Subtag Registry.

[OpenType Layout Tag Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/ttoreg) -- OpenType Layout tag registry for Script tags, Language tags, Feature tags, and Baseline tags.

[CLDR (Unicode Common Locale Data Repository)](https://cldr.unicode.org/) -- provides key building blocks for software to support the worldâ€™s languages, with the largest and most extensive standard repository of locale data available.
