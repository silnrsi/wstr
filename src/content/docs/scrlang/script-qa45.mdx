## Script description

The Numidian script was an alphabet used for writing the Berber dialect of the same name in the second century BC.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>It is thought to have derived from the [Phoenician](/scrlang/script-phnx) abjad.

The Numidian script resembles the [Tifinagh](/scrlang/script-Tfng) script currently employed by the Tuareg, the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior. However, Tifinagh is written horizontally and Numidian was normally written from bottom to top, in columns from left to right. In some bilingual Numidian and Phoenician inscriptions, the Numidian parts were written from right to left horizontally in the Phoenician manner.
