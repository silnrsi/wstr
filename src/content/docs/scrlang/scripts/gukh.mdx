## Script details

## Script description

Gurung Khe Phri is one of three scripts used for writing the Eastern and Western Gurung languages spoken in Nepal, Bhutan and India.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>These languages are often known collectively as “Gurung”, although they are not mutually intelligible. Usually, Gurung is written in the [Devanagari](/scrlang/scripts/deva) script; however, in recent times, some Gurung-speaking groups have promoted the use of two other scripts, Gurung Khe Phri and and [Khema Tamu Phri](/scrlang/scripts/Qa07).

Little is known about the Gurung Khe Phri script, but it appears to be an alphabet, written with twenty-nine consonants, six vowels, and a set of digits from 0-9. 

_This script is not currently recognized by the [ISO 15924 standard](http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/), but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
