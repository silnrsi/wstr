Some scripts have been proposed to Unicode but have either been rejected or there is not sufficient information for encoding.

These are listed here: [Not The Roadmap](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/not-the-roadmap/).

### Aiha

Aiha has been investigated and rejected as unsuitable for encoding. Documents submitted for encoding were:

- 1997-1-21 Aiha chart - Michael Everson ([aiha.html](http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/aiha.html))

### Jindai scripts

Jindai has been investigated and rejected as unsuitable for encoding. It is unclear if there were any documents actually submitted for encoding.

### Klingon

Klingon has been investigated and rejected as unsuitable for encoding. Documents submitted for encoding were:

- 1997-09-18 Proposal to encode Klingon in Plane 1 of ISO/IEC 10646-2 — Michael Everson ([WG2 N1643.htm](https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n1643/n1643.htm), L2/97-273 (not online))

- 2001-05-18 Proposal to Formally Reject Klingon for Encoding — Rick McGowan ([L2/01-212](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/01-212))
