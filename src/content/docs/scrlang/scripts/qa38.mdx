## Script description

The Jing script (also known as the Zinan script) is thought to have been developed around the 13th century for writing the Jing language.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>The origins of the Jing people are difficult to trace, but according to oral tradition and old Vietnamese texts they originated in Vietnam. The Jing ethnic community now lives in the border of China and Vietnam, mostly in coastal communities. The script is used only by a small group of people; the majority of Jing people now speak Cantonese, which they write with the [Han](/scrlang/scripts/hani) script.<br />
