The Aztec Pictograms are not yet in Unicode. At one point the script had a tentative allocation in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. However, it is no longer in the roadmap.

## Blocks

None.

## Proposals and documents

A detailed proposal is not yet available.
