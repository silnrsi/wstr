In typesetting the Latin script, text is [justified][glo-justification] on a line by first seeing how much fits on a line, then checking to see if there is a word break there (for example, a space), next checking to see if a word can be broken (hyphenated) at that point, then adding space between words and finally (although strongly deprecated!) between letters to fill out the line.

Line breaking becomes more difficult if scripts do not have word breaks, as in Tibetan and Thai, or if the word break is represented by a character rather than a space, as with the [Ethiopic _Hulet Neteb_ (&#x1361;)][hyphenation]. See [Justification][justification] and [Hyphenation][hyphenation] for details on those aspects of line breaking.
The basic algorithm for modern line breaking is to assess a text for the
possible line breaking positions and then to use those to guide the text layout
engine in its choice of actual line breaks. This article is about how to
determine those possible line break positions.

There are three general methods used by applications to determine line breaking: character category based, [hyphenation][glo-hyphenation], and dictionary based.

## Character category based

The Unicode Consortium has created a standard that describes how to do
algorithmic line breaking. Characters are categorised by their line breaking
properties, and from these, rules decide where a line break may occur. Or in the
case of [UAX #14: Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm][uni-utr14], more commonly, where line breaks may
not occur. This algorithm handles languages that use inter word spaces very
well. It handles punctuation, digits, hyphens, etc. Languages that do not have
inter word spaces may use zero width spaces to mark word boundaries and then use
this algorithm.

A common library for doing line breaking is [ICU][uni-icu] and it has the capability to
tailor the line breaking rules according to the needs of a particular language.
It also has limited support for hyphenation and dictionary based line breaking.

## Hyphenation

Hyphenation is used as a refinement to normal line breaking in that it gives
more line break opportunities, and thus allows a layout engine to make justified
text look more balanced without excessively wide inter word spaces. It also
provides a second level of line breaking in terms that hyphenation points are
considered secondary to the primary inter word line break.

Hyphenation points can be inserted into a text manually through the use of the
soft hyphen character (SHY U+00AD). This character disappears unless at the end
of a line when it becomes a hyphen, and it also tells a line breaking engine
that this is a hyphen point.

Inserting soft hyphens is hard work and gets in the way of other processes like
searching. Most typesetting engines therefore, allow for a more automated
approach whereby they use either a word list or some other language specific
algorithms to decide on hyphenation points when such a decision is needed.

See also [Hyphenation][hyphenation].

## Dictionary 

Dictionary based breaking schemes are typically used where there are not marked
word breaks. Unlike hyphenation which is only used sparsely to improve layout,
texts without word breaks must use more complex means to break lines at all, or
at least not in unhelpful places. The typical approach to dictionary based
breaking is to use a dictionary to split a paragraph into words. The aim is to
minimise the amount of 'unknown' material. That is characters not found in
words, or sequences of characters that are unknown to the dictionary. There are
3 approaches to breaking a text into words:

### Longest Match

This is also known as greedy matching. The engine starts by finding the longest
word that matches at the start of the text, and then keeps trying from there,
looking for the longest match each time. The engine may backtrack if it can't
find a match in the hope of finding a match starting from a slightly different
position. For text that is all known words, longest matching is fast and easy to
implement, but it can result in some undesirable matches where it breaks some
longer words into shorter ones.

### Perfect Match

The ideal solution is perfect matching in which the dictionary has other
information (e.g. grammatical) by which the choice as to the best way to break
the text into words can be achieved. Unfortunately, there is no way to do
absolutely perfect matching without a full understanding of the discourse of the
text. Perhaps some [LLMs][glo-llm] can get close.

### Maximal Match

Instead a compromise algorithm is the most common solution to the problem,
called maximal matching, it breaks the text into the least number of segments,
or makes each segment as long as possible (hence 'maximal'). The algorithm at its
worst is a O(n!), but using simply dynamic programming techniques can be brought
down to O(n). In addition, the dictionary may be enhanced with probabilities
that can help split excessively long words into more common shorter words if
appropriate.

### Language Tagging

One of the difficulties with dictionary based approaches is using the right
dictionary. If all text were marked with its language, and marked correctly,
there would be no problem. This is particularly a problem for minority
languages. For majority languages, of which there is usually only one per
script, the assumption that text in a particular script is in that language, is
usually correct. And so libraries like [ICU][uni-icu] identify the language based on the
script and then break the text according to the dictionary of that language.
This is fine for users of that language but causes problems for users of a
minority language since the dictionary is wrong.

One approach for minority language users is to use ZWSP (ZERO WIDTH SPACE) to identify the words in
the text and then somehow to tell the line breaking engine not to use dictionary
breaking. Either that or the text must be appropriately marked for its language
and the line breaking engine to be given a dictionary to use for the line
breaking of text in that language.
