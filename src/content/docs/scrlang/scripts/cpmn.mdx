## Script details

<ScriptDetails />

## Script description

The Cypro-Minoan script was a logosyllabary used on the island of Cyprus around 1500-1100 BC.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>It has not yet been deciphered. The name of the script reflects the possibilities that it derived from a Minoan script, such as Linear A on Minoan Crete, and is ancestral to the [Cypriot](/scrlang/scripts/cprt) script. More recently the theory that the script was brought to Cyprus by Minoan colonizers has been called into question, due to substantial differences between this script and Linear A.

Around 250 items have been discovered with Cypro-Minoan inscriptions, such as clay balls, tablets and vases. The script appears to have been mostly written from left to right, although some examples of right-to-left and boustrophedon inscriptions have been found. Most of the signs are thought to be phonographic, each sign representing a sound.
