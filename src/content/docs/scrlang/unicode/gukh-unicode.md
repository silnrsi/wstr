The Khe Phri (Gurung) script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+16140..U+1617F in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard.

## Proposals and documents

A detailed proposal is not yet available. However, one document discussing the script has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee:
- 2010-08-08 submission of GURUNG SCRIPT â€” Man Bahadur Gurung ([L2/11-047](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/11-047))
