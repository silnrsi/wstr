The Pallava script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+11F60..U+11FAF in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. 

One preliminary proposal towards encoding the script has been submitted to UTC:
- 2018-03-27 Preliminary proposal to encode Pallava in Unicode â€” Anshuman Pandey ([L2/18-083](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/18-083))
  - _Recommendations to UTC #155 April-May 2018 on Script Proposals ([L2/18-168](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2018/18168-script-rec.pdf)) (See point 11.)_
