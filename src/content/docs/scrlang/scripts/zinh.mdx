## Script description

"Code for Inherited Script" does not refer to a particular script in the conventional sense of the word.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>Rather, in the Unicode Standard, "inherited" is a property that applies to an individual character which inherits its script from the preceding characters. These include nonspacing marks, enclosing marks, and the zero width joiner/non-joiner characters. These can be used with multiple scripts.

These are not to be confused with characters classified under the ISO tag "Code for Undetermined Script" ("Common" in Unicode), which are also common to more than one formal natural script, but which do not identify themselves with the script of the preceding character. These include musical notation, and many punctuation marks.
