## Script description

The Satavahana dynasty was a royal Indian dynasty whose empire covered much of India from 230 BC possibly up until 220 AD.

<summary>Read the full description...'</summary>Satavahana rulers encouraged the use of the Prakrit language, although Sanskrit and Telegu were also used. They wrote in a Brahmic script about which little is known. The script appears to be closely related to [Brahmi](/scrlang/script-qa49) and there are conflicting reports as to whether they are simply variations of the same script.
