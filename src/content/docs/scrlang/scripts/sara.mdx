## Script description

The Sarati script is an artificial script created by J.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>R. R. Tolkien for writing the artificial language, Quenya, which is spoken in the fictional territory of Middle-earth, where many of Tolkienâ€™s novels are set.

Sarati is an abugida. Each letter, called a _sarat_, represents one phoneme. The script is based on consonants, with vowels written as diacritics. The script can be written in any direction, vertically, horizontally or [boustrophedon](/reference/glossary#boust), but is most often written vertically from top to bottom.

Sarati was created partly to provide a history for the better-known [Tengwar](/scrlang/scripts/teng) script, which is claimed to be the descendant of Sarati.
