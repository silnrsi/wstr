## How to use bibliographic sources

### To add links within text content

### To create a bibliography for a page

### To add a list of links based on tags

## Adding new sources

_For online links:_ You do not need to create a new source for every link you add to a page. It is perfectly fine to continue to use the `[link text][refname]` syntax and define the link in the page content. If, however, you think that you or someone else might want to link to the same page later it may be helpful to create an online source for it.

_For other bibliographic sources:_ You do not need to create a new source to add a bibliographic reference to a page but it would be a good idea. Then you can depend on WSTR to format the entry properly according to our bibliographic style. It will also then appear elsewhere depending on its tags/keywords.

To add a new source:

- Open the `data/sources.yaml` file.
- Search within that file to see if the source you need is already there.
- Choose a unique key for the source (see _Choosing source keys_).
- Add the new source to the file using the appropriate entry type and fields (see _Source types_ and _Source fields_). Please add it in alphabetical order by key - this will make the file easier to read and help ensure that you do not create duplicate keys.
- Save the file and commit your changes.

(To be added: info on how to use the schema checking features in VSCode.)

## Source types

The data model for WSTR sources is based closely on [BibLaTeX][biblatex-manual], although we are only using a small number of entry types and adding some custom fields. Here are the source types we are using and which fields are appropriate.

- **article** - for articles in journals
    - Required: _title_, _author_, _journaltitle_, _date_
    - Optional: _pages_, _volume_, _number_, _issn_
- **book** - for books
    - Required: _title_, _author_ and/or _editor_
    - Should also have: _date_, _publisher_, _location_ (though not strictly required)
    - Optional: _series_, _isbn_
- **inbook** - for chapters within books
    - Required: _title_, _author_, _booktitle_, _date_
    - Should also have: _publisher_, _location_, _pages_ (though not strictly required)
    - Optional: _editor_, _isbn_
- **inproceedings** - for papers or presentations given at conferences and often published in books of "proceedings"
    - Required: _title_, _author_, _date_, _booktitle_ (which could be the conference title if there are no published procedings)
    - Optional: _editor_, _isbn_, _publisher_, _location_, _pages_ 
- **misc** - for sources that do not fit other types, such as unpublished papers, videos, or presentations
    - Required: _title_, _author_
    - Optional: anything that is relevant
- **online** - for webpages, websites, and online resources, typically used for links. Do not use this for articles or books that happen to be online; use the appropriate type for those instead and add _url_ and _date_/_urldate_ fields.
    - Required: _title_, _url_, _date_ and/or _urldate_
    - Should also have: _author_ and/or _organization_  (though not strictly required)
    - Optional: _editor_

In addition to these standard fields, WSTR sources must include:
    - _entrytype_ (one of the above types)
    - _keywords_ (a comma-separated list of tags for the source).

There are also some fields that may be applicable to all source types (see section below for details):
    - _url_
    - _urldate_
    - _abstract_
    - _annotation_
    - _addendum_
    - _sortname_
    - _presort_
    - _entrysubtype_

## Source fields

Values for fields marked with (Q) should always be double-quoted strings even if they do not contain special characters. See _Source file format_ below for details of when to double-quote other strings.

    - **abstract** (Q) - _not in use except for sources migrated from ScriptSource_   
    - **addendum** - a brief note about the source that appears in lists of sources, a.k.a. "short annotation", equivalent to article frontmatter `description`.
        - Ex: `A library to manipulate font files using python`
    - **annotation** (Q) - _not in use except for sources migrated from ScriptSource_ 
    - **author** - _required for all source types except online_ - the person or people who wrote or created the work. Use `firstname lastname` format for each author, separated by ` and ` for multiple authors. Commas should not be used to separate authors. Authors who share lastnames should still be written in full.
        - Ex: `Enya Cohen and Lila Namir and I. M. Schlesinger`
        - Ex: `John Smith and Mary Smith`
    - **booktitle** - _for inbook and inproceedings_ - the title of the book or proceedings in which the work appears. Alternately can be used for the name of the conference if there are no published proceedings.
        - Ex: `Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Font Technologies`
    - **date** (Q) - the date the work was published or made publicly available. Use `yyyy-mm-dd` format where possible, but `yyyy-mm` or just `yyyy` is acceptable if the full date is not known.
        - Ex: `"2023-05-15"`
        - Ex: `"2022-11"`
        - Ex: `"2019"`
    - **editor** - the person or people who edited the work, see **author**.
    - **entrytype** - _required_ - the type of source, one of the types listed in the _Source types_ section above.
        - Ex: `article`
    - **entrysubtype** - a short indicator that this record has special use, which allow us to use it as a filter in lists. Currently only used for:
        - Ex: `f` (for 'favorite' shortcut-style @online links that are already in use and may be used again)
    - **isbn** - _for book, inbook, and inproceedings_ - 9, 10, or 13 digit [International Standard Book Number (ISBN)][isbn].
    - **issn** - _for article_ - 8 digit [International Standard Serial Number (ISSN)][issn].
    - **journaltitle** - _for article_ - the name of the journal or periodical in which the article appears.
        - Ex: `Journal of Writing Systems Technology`
    - **keywords** - _required_ - a comma-separated list of tags for the source, used to group related sources together. See [Tags](/devteam/file-location-and-frontmatter-reference/#tags).
        - Ex: `rendering, fonts, opentype, script-arab`
    - **location** - the place where the work was published. If the city is not well known, include the state/province/country as well.
        - Ex: `Paris`
        - Ex: `"Katsina, Nigeria"`
        - Ex: `"St. Peter, MN"`
    - **number** (Q) - _for article_ - the issue number of the journal in which the article appears.
    - **organization** - _for online_ - the organization responsible for the content of the webpage or website. Can be a shorthand name rather the full formal name. Will be displayed after **title** in lists of links.
        - Ex: `Wikipedia`
        - Ex: `Microsoft`
        - Ex: `SIL`
        - Ex: `Eesti Keele Instituut`
    - **pages** -  _for article, inbook, and inproceedings_ - the page range of the article, chapter, or paper within the larger work. Use `startpage-endpage` format.
        - Ex: `45-67`
    - **presort** - a two digit number 10-99 that can be used to influence the sorting order of sources in lists. Lower numbers appear first. Sources with defined presort values appear before those without. Some standard values for certain sites:
        - `10` - ScriptSource
        - `15` - software.sil.org
        - `20` - Wikipedia script pages
        - `22` - Other Wikipedia
        - `30` - Omniglot
    - **publisher** - the name of the publisher of the work.
        - Ex: `Brill`
        - Ex: `Minzu Chubanshe 民族出版社`
        - Ex: `"School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London"`
    - **series** - _for book_ - the name of the series in which the work appears, if applicable.
        - Ex: `Studies in Semitic Languages and Linguistics `
    - **sortname** - a name used to influence the sorting order of sources in bibliographies. Typically this is the lastname of the first **author** or **editor**, but can be any string. Sources are sorted alphabetically by **sortname**.
        - Ex: `Correll`
    - **title** - _required_ - the title of the work. Capitalization should follow standard [English title case][wiki-title-case] conventions, however sources may not follow this strictly, particularly those migrated from ScriptSource.
        - Ex: `Understanding Font Technologies`
    - **url** -  the URL where the work can be found online. This can be used for all source types, not just online. _Note that this field alone does not need to be double-quoted even though it contains special characters._
        - Ex: `https://robofont.com/`
        - Ex: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedilla`
        - Ex: `https://doi.org/10.1017/S0025100315000444`
    - **urldate** (Q) - the date the URL was last accessed. See **date** for formatting.
        - Ex: `"2025-11-20"`
    - **volume** (Q) - _for article_ - the volume number of the journal in which the article appears, in whatever format is given.
        - Ex: `"12"`
        - Ex: `"XIV"`

### Choosing source keys (uniquekeys)

Source keys (a.k.a. _uniquekey_) need to be unique, lowercase, with no spaces or punctuation except for a hyphen. They should follow one of three patterns, although **which style of key you choose is not important as long as it is unique**:

- Formal academic style when author/editor and date are known: `sortnameYYYY[postfix]` where `YYYY` is the year portion of **date**. The optional `postfix` is used if there are multiple works by the same author/editor in the same year, and can be any short string. Applicable to all source types, although online sources may be more easily identified using one of the other styles.
    - Ex: `esfabod2024`
    - Ex: `coulmas2006batak`
    - Ex: `mafundikwa2004a`
- Informal style, mostly for online links to common websites, when there is no clear author or date, or when formal style would be bothersome: `shortorganization-short-title` where `shortorganization` is a brief shorthand name for the website or organization responsible for the content and `short-title` is a brief shorthand name for the page.
    - Ex: `wiki-macron` (Wikipedia page on the macron diacritic)
    - Ex: `ss-script-adlm`  (ScriptSource page on Adlam script)
    - Ex: `omni-balinese` (Omniglot page on Balinese script)
    - Ex: `signwriting-transcription-systems`  (SignWriting page on writing the same signs in different transcription systems)
- Shortcut style, for common links that would be easy to remember and use: `anything-memorable`. We may make a list of these common shortcuts for easy reference.
    - Ex: `opentype` (current OpenType spec)
    - Ex: `uni-charts`  (Unicode code charts)
    - Ex: `icu`  (International Components for Unicode)
    - Ex: `ss` (Scriptsource main page)
    - Ex: `keyman`  (Keyman site)
    - Ex: `ofl`  (SIL Open Font License)

To check if a key is unique open up the `sources.yaml` file and search for the key you are considering ("key:").

## Source file format (YAML)

The `sources.yaml` file is a YAML file containing all bibliographic sources used on WSTR. Each source is represented as a YAML object with fields corresponding to the source fields described above. Some details:

- Indentation is two spaces.
- Empty fields can be omitted but can also be included with no value (e.g., `pages: `).
- Strings do not need to be quoted in block style, or on single line unless they contain the special characters `: { } [ ] , & * # ? | - < > = ! % @` oer are one of the fields noted above as (Q) requiring double quotes.

### Example showing all possible fields

```yaml

  abstract: >-
    The Arabic script in Africa contains sixteen papers on the past and present use of Arabic
    script to write African languages. These writing traditions, which are sometimes collectively
    referred to as Ajami, are discussed for single or multiple languages, with examples from all
    major linguistic phyla of Africa but one (Khoisan), and from all geographic areas of Africa
    (North, West, Central, East, and South Africa), as well as a paper on the Ajami heritage in the
    Americas. The papers analyze (ethno-) historical, literary, (socio-) linguistic, and in
    particular grammatological aspects of these previously understudied writing traditions and
    exemplify their range and scope, providing new data for the comparative study of writing
    systems, literacy in Africa, and the history of (Islam in) Africa.
  annotation: >-
    This book is relevant for the history of knowledge and literacy in (Islamic) Africa, the
    linguistic study of writing systems (Grammatology), the socio-linguistics of writing, and
    orthography development and standardization.[CR][CR]A comprehensive review of this book is
    also available.

    With the advent of multi-lingual concept in computer systems, different solution has been
    proposed and implemented. But most of these are not matured enough or has platform barriers.
    The most promising solutions are OpenType® by Microsoft and Adobe, and Apple Advanced
    Typography by Apple Inc. The OpenType® specifications are open source, in spite of that the
    support of OpenType® on different platforms is not mature and even not consistent among
    Microsoft and Adobe applications.(CR)(CR)Two different techniques have been adapted to digitize
    the Nastaleeq script. One is Ligature based approach and other is character based. Both
    approaches have their own limitations. The most dominating solution is ligature based Nori
    Nastaleeq font. But this font can only be run in proprietary software InPage®. And this
    software can only be run in a MS Windows environment. The other promising solution is character
    based Nafees Nastaleeq font. This font uses OpenType® technology to generate ligatures.
    OpenType® solution is very slow for Nastaleeq script and has limitations for proportional
    spacing and justification.(CR)(CR)TeX is a revolutionary typesetting system developed by
    Donald Knuth in 1980s. It is a defecto standard for many scientific and mathematic
    publications. TeX was mainly aimed at typesetting mathematics and English text. Omega is an
    extension of TeX developed by John Plaice and Yannis Haralambous. Its first release, aims
    primarily at improving TeX's multilingual abilities. Omega allows multiple inputs and output
    character sets, and uses programmable filters to translate from one encoding to another, to
    perform contextual analysis. The pixel level control of TeX over glyphs and filtering approach
    of Omega suits them best for complex scripts like Nastaleeq.
  annotation: >-
    This thesis goes into great detail about how the Nastaleeq style of Arabic script works. It is a
    useful read for anyone interested in implementing support for Nastaleeq.
