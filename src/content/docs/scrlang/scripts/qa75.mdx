## Script description

The Kaddare script is also referred to as the Kaddariya script.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>It was created in the 1950s by Xuseen Sheekh Axmed Kaddare to write the Somali language.  

The Kaddare script was considered the best indigenous script to write Somali by the 1961 linguistic commission, which was established by the Somali government, and the 1966 UNESCO commission. However, the Latin-based orthography was the top choice, and became the official script in 1972.

Kaddare makes use of upper and lower case letters, where the lower case letters are written in cursive so as not to lift the pen.
