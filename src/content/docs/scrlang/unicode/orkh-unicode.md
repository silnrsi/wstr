The Old Turkic script was encoded in The Unicode Standard version 5.2. The script is encoded in the following block. This character block contains the letters needed for writing in both the Orkhon and the Yenisei styles; where the letterforms vary between the two styles, each is encoded separately. 

table:
Blocks | Character Range | Added in Unicode Version | Unicode Chart |
Old Turkic| 10C00..10C4F | 5.2 | {link:http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U10C00.pdf U10C00.pdf} |
