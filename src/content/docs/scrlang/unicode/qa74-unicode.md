The Bhujinmol script is not yet in Unicode. Bhujinmol may be considered one of seven documented styles of the [Newar script](/scrlang/scripts/newa) or it may end up being encoded as a separate script.

## Proposals and documents

One proposal for its inclusion has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and WG2:
- 2014-10-28 Introducing the Bhujinmol Script â€” Anshuman Pandey ([WG2 N4555](https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n4555.pdf), [L2/14-283](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/14-283))
