## Script details

## Script description

The Fula Ba script was created by Adama Ba of Mali, around 1963.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>It is one of two African alphabets used for writing the Fula languages spoken in Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gambia, Chad, Sierra Leone, Benin, Guinea-Bissau, Sudan, Central African Republic, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Liberia, and Gabon. The second of these alphabets is [Fula Dita](/scrlang/scripts/qa01). The Fula languages are more commonly written with the [Latin](/scrlang/scripts/Latn) or [Arabic](/scrlang/scripts/Arab) scripts (Ajami style) than with either of the two Fula alphabets. Of the two, Fula Dita has been used more widely than Fula Ba.
