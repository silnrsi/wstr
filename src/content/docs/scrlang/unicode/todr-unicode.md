The Todhri script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+105C0..U+105FF in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. 

One proposal for its inclusion has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and WG2:

- 2009-09-30 Old Albanian Scripts — Deborah Anderson, Jason Glavy ([L2/09-328](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/09-328))

- 2020-07-10 Proposal for encoding the Todhri script in the SMP of the UCS — SEI / Michael Everson (WG2 N5139, ([L2/20-188](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/20-188))

  - _Recommendations to UTC #164 July 2020 on Script Proposals ([L2/20-169](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20169-script-adhoc-rept.pdf)) (See point 4.)_

  - _Recommendations to UTC #165 October 2020 on Script Proposals ([L2/20-250](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20250-script-adhoc-rept.pdf)) (See point 2.)_
