## Script details

## Script description

Tikamuli is one of two scripts used specifically for writing the Sunuwar language spoken in Nepal and Sikkim.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>Tikamuli is used primarily in Nepal, and [Jenticha](/scrlang/scripts/qa05) is used primarily in Sikkim. In both places, Sunuwar can also be written in the [Devanagari](/scrlang/scripts/Deva) script.

Tikamuli is named after its inventor, Tikaram Mulicha. It is not genetically related to any other scripts, although some letters appear to have been based on the shapes of [Limbu](/scrlang/scripts/Limb) and [Lepcha](/scrlang/scripts/Lepc) letters.

The script is an abugida; every consonant contains an inherent vowel, which can be modified by appending vowel diacritics to the consonant or silenced by adding a _virama_ below the consonant. There is also one independent vowel letter which represents /É™/. Word-initial vowels are written with this letter and a vowel diacritic if appropriate.

Vowel length marks are also used. Any written consonant can carry up to one vowel diacritic and one vowel length mark.

Tikamuli uses script-specific digits from 0-9, and Latin punctuation.
