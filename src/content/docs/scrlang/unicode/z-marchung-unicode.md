The Marchung script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+1E560..U+1E59F in the {link:http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/ Roadmap to the SMP} for the Unicode Standard. 

The {link:http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/sei/ Script Encoding Initiative} includes this script in their list of “Scripts Not Yet Encoded”. Contributions here may support their efforts.
