## Script description

The Gaelic variant of the Latin script was used between the 16th and 20th centuries for writing Irish.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...'</summary>Modern and digital forms of the script are based on traditional hand-written manuscript styles.

There are a number of typefaces subsumed under the term ‘Gaelic type’. Michael Everson identifies over 100 Gaelic typefaces dating from 1567 to the present. All Gaelic typefaces include the twenty-six letters of the Latin alphabet, plus the accented vowels and dotted consonants used for writing Irish, and the Tironian sign [_et_](https://scriptsource.org/char/U00204A), which represents the Irish word _agus_, meaning “and”. Archaic ligatures are also sometimes included.

Gaelic type is now largely restricted to decorative contexts. Modern Irish is written using the following Latin letters:

a á b c d e é f g h i í l m n o ó p r s t u ú<br />
j k q v w x y z (for loanwords only)
