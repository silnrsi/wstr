One proposal toward encoding the script has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee:

- 2020-08-20 Introducing the Goyakanadi Alphabet â€” Shashank Shenoy Basty ([L2/20-264](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetMatchingDocs.pl?L2/20-264))

  - _Recommendations to UTC #165 October 2020 on Script Proposals ([L2/20-250](http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20250-script-adhoc-rept.pdf)) (See point 10.)_
