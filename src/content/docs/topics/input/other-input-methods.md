Although a keyboard (either a physical keyboard or a touch screen keyboard)
is likely the most common means of data input, other possibilities exist.
Among these are:

- Voice recognition
- Handwriting recognition
- Optical character recognition

## Voice recognition

With voice recognition (also known as speech-to-text),
a person speaks into the microphone of a computer or phone.
The device then analyzes the recorded sounds and matches them to information
about a particular language, attempting to produce the corresponding text.
Because this method may require large amounts of written text and correspoinding recordings,
it may not be feasible for a language that is relatively new in the digital space.
Text produced in this manner needs to be verified for accuracy.

See [Speech recognition][speechrecognition] for more details.

## Handwriting recognition

With hand writing recognition, a person draws characters,
often with a stylus on a touch-sensitive screen,
and the device (phone, tablet or computer) translates these drawings into characters.

See [Handwriting recognition][handwritingrecognition] for more details.

## Optical character recognition

Optical character recognition (or OCR) involves taking a visual copy of text
(usually printed text, but possibly handwritten text)
and attempting to detect what characters are there.
Text produced in this manner needs to be verified for accuracy.

See [Optical character recognition][OCR] for more details.
