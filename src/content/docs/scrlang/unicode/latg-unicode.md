Unicode largely treats the Gaelic script as a font variant of the Latin alphabet. However, some letters are encoded separately:

Insular G (U+A77D, U+1D79)<br />
Insular D (U+A779, U+A77A)<br />
Insular F (U+A77B, U+A77C)<br />
Turned insular G (U+A77E, U+A77F)<br />
Insular R (U+A782, U+A783)<br />
Insular S (U+A784, U+A785)<br />
Insular T (U+A786, U+A787)

These were encoded in version 5.1 of the Unicode Standard.
