**This site is a collection of resources for supporting alphabets, scripts, and writing systems on digital devices and communication platforms.** It is more of a library than an encyclopedia, and is intended for a wide range of people—from beginners to experts. Over time this will become the long-term home for much of the information currently on other SIL Writing Systems Technology sites, including [ScriptSource][ss], [Font Development Best Practices][fdbp], [SIL Font Development Guide][silfontdev], and [scripts.sil.org][sso].

  <Card title="Guides" icon="open-book">
    [Application Development Best Practice](/guides/app-development-best-practice) is a thorough guide for developers who want their software to be able to handle a wide range of global writing systems.

    [Font Design and Development](/guides/font-design-and-development) covers many of the tools and technical issues involved in creating fonts, particularly for complex writing systems.
