Computers were originally designed to use left-to-right (LTR) scripts. Examples of LTR scripts include Roman, Cyrillic, Ethiopic, and Indic scripts. There are also absolute right-to-left (RTL) scripts (some instances of Hebrew), mixed RTL (Arabic, Syriac, Thaana), top-to-bottom-RTL (Chinese and Japanese are examples of these), and top-to-bottom-LTR (Mongolian). These are the most common types in use today. There are, of course, other possibilities, such as [boustrophedon](/reference/glossary/#boust). When typesetting historic texts, being able to handle this system may also be necessary, but is rarely required.
