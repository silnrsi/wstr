The Eebee Hmong script (also called Puaj Txwm) is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+1E150..U+1E1FF in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. The [Script Encoding Initiative](http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/sei/) includes this script in their list of “Scripts Not Yet Encoded”. Contributions here may support their efforts.

One proposal for its inclusion has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and WG2:
