## Script description

Writing in the state of Elam, in modern-day southwest Iran, took three forms.

<summary>Read the full description...</summary>Proto-Elamite is the oldest of the three, and was used between 3100-2900 BC. It has not been deciphered but consists of more than 1,000 signs and is thought to be partly logographic. The other two writing systems in Elam were Linear Elamite and Elamite Cuneiform.
