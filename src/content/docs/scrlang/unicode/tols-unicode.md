The Tolong Siki script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+11B80..U+11BBF in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard.

## Proposals and documents

A preliminary proposal for its inclusion has been submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and WG2:
