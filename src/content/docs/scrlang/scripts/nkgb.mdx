## Script details

<ScriptDetails />

## Script description

Nakhi Geba (also called 'Na-'Khi ²Ggŏ-¹baw or Naxi Geba) is one of three scripts used for writing the Naxi language, a Tibeto-Burman language spoken by approximately 310,000 people in the Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan, and in Tibet.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>Naxi has also been written in the Latin and, more famously, the Dongba scripts.

Nakhi Geba is thought to have been developed around 1200-1250 AD but was never widely used; its primary use was the transcription of religious mantras. There are few remaining texts in the script, and little is known about it. It was a syllabary, and the shapes of the letters appear to have been variously based on Chinese and Dongba characters, with some original designs.

## Unicode status

The Naxi Geba script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+1AD00..U+1AFCF in the [Roadmap to the SMP](http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/) for the Unicode Standard. There seems to be disagreement on whether Naxi Dongba and Nakhi Geba should be considered the same script (see also the [Unicode Status (Naxi Dongba)](https://scriptsource.org/entry/lb7t8h9k6v) entry).
