## Script description

The Zhuang Square script (also called Sawndip or Fāngkuài Zhuàngzì) is a logographic script previously used for writing Zhuang, a northern Tai language still spoken by about 10 million people in China.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>It is not known whether this script is still in use; some scholars claim it is extinct whilst others claim it is still used in rural areas. The present official script for writing Zhuang is [Latin](/scrlang/script-latn).

The Zhuang Square  script is made up of a combination of Chinese characters, Chinese-like characters, and symbols borrowed from other scripts such as the [Latin](/scrlang/script-latn) alphabet and (possibly) [Myanmar](/scrlang/script-Mymr). There is only one dictionary published in Zhuang Square script; this lists 10,000 characters.
