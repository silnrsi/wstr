## Script description

Coorgi-Cox script was created by the German linguist, Gregg Cox.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...'</summary>He formally introduced this script in April 2005. It was developed to write the [Kodava language](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/kfa), which is also referred to as Coorgi. Coorgi-Cox is comprised of eight vowels, 26 consonants and a double vowel marker. Each letter represents a different sound.  

The Kodava language is classified as a Dravidian language that is specifically used in the Kodagu district, or Coorg region, of the Karnataka state in India. Since no traditional written script exists for the Kodava language, Kannada script and the Coorgi-Cox script are used. Currently, there is widespread debate as to whether switching from Kannada script to Coorgi-Cox script would be beneficial or whether switching to a Latin alphabet based writing system would be more useful.
