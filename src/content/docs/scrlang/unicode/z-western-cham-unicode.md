The Western Cham script is not yet in Unicode. The script has a tentative allocation at U+1E200..U+1E26F in the {link:http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/ Roadmap to the SMP} for the Unicode Standard. 

Several documents toward encoding the script have been submitted to WG2 and the Unicode Technical Committee:
