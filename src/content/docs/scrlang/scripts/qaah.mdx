## Script details

## Script description

Eshkol-Wachman Movement Notation (EWMN) was developed by the choreographer Noa Eshkol (daughter of the third Israeli Prime Minister, Levi Eshkol) and the architect Abraham Wachman, in Israel in 1958.

<details>
<summary>Read the full description...</summary>It is a notation system to describe body movements, particularly but not exclusively in the context of writing down dance scores.

EWMN has had such diverse applications as the transcription of sign languages, in teaching martial arts, and to record animal behaviour, for example courting behaviour. It has also been used as an aid in the diagnosis of Autism spectrum disorders, to demonstrate abnormal reflexes and patterns of movement, which can be indicative of such a disorder.

The system is written on a specially ruled page with horizontal lines representing parts of the body, and vertical lines marking out columns representing units of time. The page can be ruled so that as many or as few body parts as are necessary can be represented. The symbols themselves represent movements, which are written from left to right in chronological order.
